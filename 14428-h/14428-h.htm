  <p>In the early part of last year, a box of manuscripts and the
  trunks belonging to Sir Isaac Brock, which had remained locked
  and unexamined for nearly thirty years, were at length opened, as
  the general's last surviving brother, Savery, in whose possession
  they had remained during that period, was then, from disease of
  the brain, unconscious of passing events. With that sensibility
  which shrinks from the sight of objects that remind us of a
  much-loved departed relative or friend, he had allowed the
  contents to remain untouched; and when they saw the light, the
  general's uniforms, including the one in which he fell, were much
  moth-eaten, but the manuscripts were happily uninjured. On the
  return of the Editor from South America in May last, he for the
  first time learnt the existence of these effects; and a few weeks
  after, having hastily perused and assorted the letters and other
  papers, he decided on their<a name="Page_-6" id="Page_-6"></a>
  publication. Whether this decision was wise, the reader must
  determine. If, on the one hand, part of their interest be lost in
  the lapse of years; on the other, they, and the comments they
  have elicited, can now be published with less risk of wounding
  private feelings.</p>

  <p>It has been the Editor's study to avoid all unnecessary
  remarks on the letters in this volume, so as to allow the writers
  to speak for themselves. But he has deemed it a sacred obligation
  due to the memory of Sir Isaac Brock, to withhold nothing
  descriptive of his energetic views and intentions, and of the
  obstacles he experienced in the vigorous prosecution of the
  contest&mdash;obstacles which his gallant spirit could not brook,
  and which necessarily exposed "his valuable life" much more than
  it would have been in offensive operations.<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
  id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
  "fnanchor">[1]</a> He regrets, however, that in the performance
  of this duty, he must necessarily give pain to the relatives of
  the late Sir George Prevost, of whose military government in
  Canada he would much rather have written in praise than in
  censure.</p>

  <p>Brief memoirs are inserted, at the conclusion of the Appendix,
  of one of Sir Isaac Brock's brothers, the bailiff or chief
  magistrate of Guernsey, and of two of their nephews, Lieutenant
  E.W. Tupper, R.N., and Colonel<a name="Page_-5" id="Page_-5"></a>
  W. De Vic Tupper, of the Chilian service. The premature fate of
  these two promising young officers is, to those who knew them
  best, still a source of unceasing regret and of embittering
  remembrance.</p>

  <p>The notices of the celebrated Tecumseh interspersed throughout
  the volume, and the connected sketch of him near its close, can
  scarcely fail to interest the reader; that sketch is drawn from
  various and apparently authentic sources, and the Editor believes
  that it is more copious than any which has yet appeared of this
  distinguished Indian chief. A perusal will perhaps awaken
  sympathy in behalf of a much-injured people; it may also tend to
  remove the films of national prejudice, and prove that virtue and
  courage are not confined to any particular station or country,
  but that they may exist as well in the wilds of the forest, as in
  the cultivated regions of civilization.</p>

  <p>The Guernsey family of BROCK is probably of English origin,
  but we have been unable to ascertain the period of its first
  establishment in the island. The parochial register of St.
  Peter-Port extends only to the year 1563, soon after which time
  it contains the name of Philip Brock. By "Robson's Armorial
  Bearings of the Nobility and Gentry of Great Britain and
  Ireland," eight families of the name of Brock appear to bear
  different arms, one of which was borne by all the Brocks of
  Guernsey&mdash;viz. azure, a fleur de lis or, on a chief argent a
  lion pass. guard. gu.&mdash;crest, an escallop or<a name=
  "FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
  class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;until the death of Sir Isaac
  Brock, when new and honorary armorial bearings were granted by
  the sovereign to his family. Brock is <a name="Page_2" id=
  "Page_2"></a>the ancient Saxon name for badger, and as such is
  still retained in English dictionaries. Froissart,<a name=
  "FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
  class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in his Chronicles, makes mention of Sir
  Hugh Brock, an English knight, keeper of the castle of Derval, in
  Brittany, for his cousin Sir Robert Knolles, who was governor of
  all the duchy, and resided in Brest, during the absence of the
  duke in England. The French overran Brittany at this period, and
  leaving 2,000 men near Brest, so as to prevent its receiving
  succours, sat down with "great engines" before the castle of
  Derval, to the siege of which came the constable of France, the
  Duke of Bourbon, the Earls of Alen&ccedil;on and of Perche, and a
  great number of the barony and chivalry of France. The castle
  being sore oppressed, Sir Hugh Brock was at length constrained to
  agree to surrender it at the end of two months, if not relieved
  by that time. Sir Robert Knolles, hearing this, also began to
  treat with the French; and while at the head of 30,000 men, he
  was afterwards defeated by Bertrand du Guesclin. These events
  occurred in the reign of Edward the Third, about the middle of
  the fourteenth century, when the English were driven out of
  France; and as Guernsey is in the direct course between Brittany
  and England, may not one of Sir Hugh Brock's family, on his
  passage across the Channel, have visited the island and settled
  there?</p>

  <p>The common ancestor of the present Guernsey <a name="Page_3"
  id="Page_3"></a>family of the name of Brock was William Brock,
  Esq., a native of the island, who died in the year 1776, and was
  the grandfather of the subject of this volume. He had three sons
  and one daughter, who became connected by marriage with some of
  the principal and most ancient families of Guernsey; namely,
  William, married to Judith, daughter of James De Beauvoir,
  Esq.;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> John, married to
  Elizabeth De Lisle, daughter of the then lieutenant-bailiff of
  the island; Henry, married to Susan Saumarez, sister of the late
  Admiral Lord de Saumarez; and Mary, wife of John Le Marchant,
  Esq<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>John Brock, Esq., born January 24, 1729, second son of the
  above-named William, had by his wife, Elizabeth De Lisle, a very
  numerous family of ten sons and four daughters, of whom eight
  sons and two daughters reached maturity. He died in June, 1777,
  at Dinan, in Brittany, whither he had gone for the benefit of the
  waters, at the early age of forty-eight years.<a name=
  "FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
  class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In his youth he was a midshipman in the
  navy, and in that capacity had made a voyage to India, which was
  then considered a great undertaking. As he was <a name="Page_4"
  id="Page_4"></a>possessed of much activity of mind and
  considerable talent, his death was an irreparable loss to his
  children, who were of an age to require all the care and counsels
  of a father; the eldest, John, having only completed his
  seventeenth year. They were left in independent, if not in
  affluent, circumstances; but the fond indulgence of a widowed
  mother, who could deny them no enjoyment, tended, notwithstanding
  their long minority, to diminish their patrimony.</p>

  <p>Isaac Brock, the eighth son, was born in the parish of St.
  Peter-Port, Guernsey, on the 6th of October, 1769, the year which
  gave birth to Napoleon and Wellington. In his boyhood he was,
  like his brothers, unusually tall, robust, and precocious, and,
  with an appearance much beyond his age, remarkable chiefly for
  extreme gentleness. In his eleventh year he was sent to school at
  Southampton, and his education was concluded by his being placed
  for a twelvemonth under a French Protestant clergyman at
  Rotterdam, for the purpose of learning the French language. His
  eldest brother, John, a lieutenant in the 8th, the King's,
  regiment, being promoted to a company by purchase, Isaac
  succeeded, also by purchase, to the ensigncy which consequently
  became vacant in that regiment, and to which he was appointed on
  the 2d of March, 1785, soon after he had completed his fifteenth
  year. He joined in England, and was quartered there in different
  places for a few years. Having entered the army at so early
  <a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>an age, he happily felt sensible
  of his deficiencies of education, and for a long period he
  devoted his leisure mornings to study, locking the door of his
  room until one o'clock, to prevent intrusion. In 1790 he was
  promoted to a lieutenantcy, and was quartered in Guernsey and
  Jersey. At the close of that year he obtained an independent
  company, by raising the requisite number of men to complete it,
  and was put on half pay. He exchanged soon after, by giving the
  difference, into the 49th, which regiment he joined at Barbadoes,
  in 1791, and he remained doing duty there, and afterwards at
  Jamaica, until 1793, when he was compelled to return very
  suddenly to England on sick leave, having nearly fallen a victim
  to the pestilential effects of the climate, and an immediate
  embarkation being pronounced his only chance of recovery. His
  first cousin, Lieutenant Henry Brock, of the 13th foot, who was
  ill at the same time at Jamaica, died of the fever; and the
  survivor always thought that he was indebted for his life to the
  affectionate attentions of his servant, Dobson, whom he
  subsequently ever treated with the kindness of a brother, until
  he died in his service shortly before himself, in Canada. The
  mention of the following trait of great determination of
  character may serve as a guide to other young officers, similarly
  circumstanced. When Captain Brock joined the 49th, the peace of
  the regiment was disturbed by one of those vile pests of
  society&mdash;a confirmed duellist. Captain Brock <a name=
  "Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>soon proved to his brother captain, who
  took advantage of being a dead shot, that he was neither to be
  bullied nor intimidated, and the consequence was a challenge from
  the latter, which was promptly accepted. On the ground, Captain
  Brock, who was very tall and athletic, observed that to stand at
  twelve paces was not to meet his antagonist on any thing like
  equal terms, and, producing a handkerchief, insisted on firing
  across it. This the duellist positively declined, and being in
  consequence soon after compelled to leave the regiment, the
  officers were thus relieved, by the firm and resolute conduct of
  a very young man, of the presence of one with whom all social
  intercourse had previously been difficult and dangerous. On his
  return from Jamaica, Captain Brock was employed on the recruiting
  service in England, and afterwards in charge of a number of
  recruits at Jersey. On the 24th June, 1795, he purchased his
  majority, and remained in command of the recruits until the
  return of the regiment to England the following year. On the 25th
  of October, 1797, just after he had completed his twenty-eighth
  year, Major Brock purchased his lieutenant-colonelcy, and soon
  after became senior lieut.-colonel of the 49th. This was very
  rapid promotion for one who had not only entered the army during
  a period of profound peace, but had been five years an ensign,
  and, having no interest excepting that which his own merit might
  have procured him, he was generally considered at that <a name=
  "Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>time as one of the most fortunate
  officers in the service. In a little more than seven years, he
  had risen from an ensign to be a lieut.-colonel. Owing to gross
  mismanagement and peculation on the part of his predecessor, who
  was in consequence recommended privately to sell out, if he did
  not wish to stand the ordeal of a court martial, the regiment was
  sadly disorganized; but the commander in chief, the late Duke of
  York, was heard to declare that Lieut.-Colonel Brock, from one of
  the worst, had made the 49th one of the best regiments in the
  service.</p>

  <p>In 1798, the 49th was quartered in Jersey, whence it
  proceeded, to England early the following year, to take part in
  the projected expedition to Holland, as in 1799 the British
  Government determined on sending a strong military force to that
  country, then in alliance with the French republic, which force
  was to be joined by a Russian army. The first English division,
  consisting of twelve battalions of infantry, among which was the
  49th, and a small body of cavalry, assembled at Southampton under
  Sir Ralph Abercromby, and, having embarked, finally sailed from
  the Downs early in August. On the 26th of that month, the fleet,
  consisting of fifteen ships of the line, from forty-five to fifty
  frigates, sloops, and smaller vessels of war, and about one
  hundred and thirty sail of transports, anchored along the coast
  of North Holland, from the mouth of the Texel as far as
  Calants-Oge. Early the next morning, <a name="Page_8" id=
  "Page_8"></a>the flank companies were landed, under the
  protection of the guns of the fleet. An engagement commenced as
  the British were about to march forward; but being continually
  reinforced by the arrival of fresh troops, they compelled the
  enemy to retreat. This warm engagement lasted till four o'clock
  in the afternoon, and cost the British about 1,000 men. Sir Ralph
  Abercromby, having become master of the point, or peninsula, of
  the Helder, completed his landing, entrenched his advanced posts
  toward the right, and occupied with his left the point of the
  Helder, and the batteries there which had been evacuated. In
  these positions he awaited the arrival of the second division,
  under the Duke of York, the commander-in-chief, which remained in
  England until news were received of the landing of the first on
  the coast of Holland. These two divisions were composed of thirty
  battalions of infantry, of 600 men each, 500 cavalry, and a fine
  train of artillery.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
  "FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class=
  "fnanchor">[7]</a> During this campaign, Lieut.-Colonel Brock
  distinguished himself in command of his regiment, which, on the
  2d of October, in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee, or Bergen, had
  Captain Archer and Ensign Ginn killed; and Major Hutchinson,
  Captains Sharp and Robins, Lieutenant Urquhart and Ensign Hill,
  wounded; Lieutenant Johnston missing, and supposed to be killed,
  exclusive of nearly one hundred non-commissioned officers and
  <a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>privates killed and
  wounded.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In this action,
  Lieut.-Colonel Brock was slightly wounded, although his name does
  not appear in the returns; and his life was in all probability
  preserved by his wearing, as the weather was very cold, a stout
  cotton handkerchief over a thick black silk cravat, both of which
  were perforated by a bullet, and which prevented its entering his
  neck: the violence of the blow was, however, so great, as to stun
  and dismount him. The following letter contains some interesting
  particulars relative to this campaign, and the part taken in it
  by the 49th.</p>

  <p><i>Lieutenant-Colonel Brock, 49th regiment, to his brother,
  brevet Lieutenant-Colonel John Brock, 81st regiment, at the Cape
  of Good Hope</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"LONDON, November 26, 1799.</p>

    <p>"I was pretty constant in my correspondence with you whilst
    the regiment was quartered at Portsmouth, and no opportunity
    offered from thence direct to the Cape without taking letters
    and newspapers from either Savery or myself, and often from
    both; but the very active and busy life I have passed since put
    an end to all such communications. Knowing, however, that you
    will be gratified in hearing from my own pen the various
    incidents which have occurred since that time, I proceed to
    give you the substance of <a name="Page_10" id=
    "Page_10"></a>them. You will have seen in the public prints
    that the 49th embarked among the first regiments under Sir
    Ralph Abercromby, and that the army, amounting to about 10,000
    men, after beating the seas from the 8th to the 27th of August,
    effected a landing near the Helder; that the enemy most
    unaccountably offered no opposition to our landing; and that,
    after a well-contested fight of ten hours, he retreated, and
    left us in quiet possession of the Heights, extending the whole
    length of the Peninsula. The 4th Brigade, under General
    Moore,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> consisting of the
    Royals, 25th, 49th, 79th, and 92d, landed to the left, where
    the greatest opposition was expected, as it was natural to
    suppose that so essential an object as the Helder would be
    defended to the last, but, to our utter astonishment, the enemy
    gave us no annoyance; on the contrary, soon after the affair on
    the right had terminated, he evacuated the town, which we took
    quiet possession of the following morning, and with it the
    whole of the fleet. The garrison, consisting of 1,600 men,
    could easily have been intercepted had it not been for a large
    body of cavalry and a number of cannon, which completely
    commanded a plain of a mile and a half in breadth, necessary to
    be crossed to get to them: as we had neither the one nor the
    other, it would have been the height of folly to attempt it.
    The regiments which distinguished themselves most on this
    occasion were the 23d, 27th, and 55th. <a name="Page_11" id=
    "Page_11"></a>The evening of our landing, a reinforcement of
    5,000 men arrived, but could not disembark until two days
    after, owing to the badness of the weather. During all this
    time the troops lay exposed on the sand hills, without the
    least shelter to cover them against the wind and rain. At
    length the army moved forward eleven miles, and got into
    cantonments along a canal extending the whole breadth of the
    country, from the Zuyder sea on the one side to the main ocean
    on the other, protected by an amazingly strong dyke, running
    half a mile in front of the line. In this position we remained
    unmolested until the 10th of September, on which day the enemy
    made a most desperate attack in three columns, two on the right
    and one on the centre of the line: he could not avoid being
    beaten, as it was the most injudicious step imaginable, and his
    loss was in proportion very great. The Guards, 20th, and 40th,
    acted conspicuous parts in this affair. The 49th was here again
    out of the way, with the exception indeed of Savery, whom
    nothing could keep from going to see what was doing on the
    right, and as it happened he proved of great use to Colonel
    Smith,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> whom he assisted
    from the field after being wounded. The French soldier was
    taught to consider the British troops as the most undisciplined
    rabble in the world, and he advanced confident of conquest; but
    this affair, and others which followed, made <a name="Page_12"
    id="Page_12"></a>him very soon change his opinion. Nothing
    remarkable occurred after this until the arrival of the Duke of
    York with the remainder of the British troops and 16,000
    Russians, which increased the army to about 35,000 men.
    Continued rain, however, prevented any thing being done before
    the 19th, when the whole army was put in motion. Sir Ralph took
    12,000, of which the 4th Brigade formed a part, to the left on
    the evening preceding, and got possession of the city of Horn
    the following morning at daylight, without a shot being fired:
    200 prisoners were taken. Horn is a very populous, handsome
    city, and evidently in the interest of the Prince of Orange.
    Nothing could exceed the joy of the inhabitants at our arrival,
    and in proportion as they rejoiced they mourned our departure,
    which took place before sun-set, in consequence of a fatal
    disaster which had befallen the Russians on the right. They of
    course threw the blame off their own shoulders, and wished to
    attribute the whole misfortune to the want of concert and a
    proper support on the part of the British; but I verily believe
    the real fact to be this. After most gallantly driving the
    enemy before them as far as Bergen, where it was previously
    arranged they should halt, they dispersed for the sake of
    plunder;&mdash;the French, hearing of this disorder, renewed
    the attack, and never gave the Russians an opportunity to form,
    but continued driving them with the bayonet until they
    encountered a <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>body of
    English, under General Manners and Prince William, whose
    brigades suffered considerably. The Russians were, however,
    thus happily enabled to effect their retreat without further
    molestation; they were certainly the original cause of this
    disaster, but whether the British were sufficiently brisk in
    coming to their assistance, is doubted. The Russians in their
    persons are rather short of stature, and very thick and clumsy;
    they have nothing expressive in their features, but resemble
    much the Chinese countenance. I remarked an exception to this
    rule in a grenadier battalion, who, with tall, elegant persons,
    possessed remarkably fine, commanding faces. The officers in
    general are the most despicable wretches I ever saw:
    accustomed, as they have always been, to fight with troops much
    inferior to themselves, they thought themselves invincible.
    They take the field with an immense number of artillery, with
    which they cover their front and flanks, and thus never dreamed
    it possible, from their former experience, for troops to rally
    after being once beaten. This fatal security was the cause of
    the misfortune which befell the allies on the 19th. After the
    retreat from Horn, the 4th brigade took its station on the
    right, preparatory evidently to being actively employed;
    accordingly, on the 2d of October, the weather not permitting
    it sooner, the brigade assembled before daylight at Petten, and
    formed the advanced guard of a column, consisting of 10,000
    men, which was <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>to proceed
    along the beach to Egmont-op-Zee. After every thing had been
    properly arranged, it moved forward, supported by 1,000
    cavalry, under Lord Paget. It was intended that the reserve,
    under Colonel M'Donald, should cover our flank, and that the
    column should rapidly advance to Egmont, in order to turn the
    flank of the enemy at Bergen. This was, however, prevented by a
    strong body of the enemy, who engaged the reserve the moment it
    ascended the sand hills; and although he retreated before the
    reserve, he constrained Colonel M'Donald to follow in a
    different direction to that intended, thereby leaving our left
    flank uncovered. But this did not impede our moving forward,
    and it was not until we had proceeded five or six miles that we
    found the least opposition. The enemy then appeared in small
    force, and the 25th was ordered up the sand hills, but, he
    having increased, the 79th followed, and it was not long before
    the 49th was also ordered to form on the left of that regiment.
    It is impossible to give you an adequate idea of the nature of
    the ground, which I can only compare to the sea in a storm. On
    my getting to the left of the 79th, I found that its flank was
    already turned, and that the ground, which we were to occupy,
    did not afford the least shelter: my determination was
    instantly taken. I had gone on horseback to view the ground,
    and on my return to the regiment, which I met advancing, I
    found the left actually engaged with the enemy, who <a name=
    "Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>had advanced much beyond our left.
    I, however, continued advancing with six companies, and left
    Colonel Sheaffe with the other four to cover our left: the
    instant I came up to the 79th, I ordered a charge, which I
    assure you was executed with the greatest gallantry, though not
    in the greatest order, as the nature of the ground admitted of
    none. The enemy, however, gave way on every side, and our loss
    would have been very trifling had the 79th charged
    straightforward; but unfortunately it followed the course the
    49th had taken, thereby leaving our right entirely exposed. I
    detached Lord Aylmer<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id=
    "FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
    "fnanchor">[11]</a> with the grenadiers, who, after charging
    different times, totally cleared our right. The 25th then
    advanced, and behaved with the greatest good conduct. The enemy
    after this never attempted to make a stand, but continued to
    retreat, and their loss on this occasion was very considerable.
    Nothing could exceed the gallantry of the 25th, 49th, 79th, and
    92d. For my own part, I had every reason to be satisfied with
    the conduct of both officers and men, and no commanding officer
    could be more handsomely supported than I was on that day, ever
    glorious to the 49th. Poor Archer brought his company to the
    attack in a most soldierlike manner; and even after he had
    received his mortal wound, he animated his men, calling on them
    to go on to victory, to glory; and no order could be more
    <a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>effectually obeyed: he is an
    irreparable loss to the service. I got knocked down soon after
    the enemy began to retreat, but never quitted the field, and
    returned to my duty in less than half an hour. Savery acted
    during the whole day as aide-de-camp either to Sir Ralph or
    Moore, and nothing could surpass his activity and gallantry. He
    had a horse shot under him, and had all this been in his line,
    he must have been particularly noticed, as he has become the
    astonishment of all who saw him. We remained that night and the
    following on the sand hills; you cannot conceive our wretched
    state, as it blew and rained nearly the whole time. Our men
    bore all this without grumbling, although they had nothing to
    eat but the biscuits they carried with them, which by this time
    were completely wet. We at length got into Egmont, and on the
    following day (5th) into Alkmaar, where we enjoyed ourselves
    amazingly. Alkmaar is a most delightful city; but the
    inhabitants are rank patriots, and none of the higher class
    remained to welcome our arrival. The following day another
    engagement ensued,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
    "FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
    "fnanchor">[12]</a> in consequence of the Russians advancing
    further than they were ordered to do: during this severe
    contest we were snugly in church. It is extraordinary that both
    parties were so beaten as to find a retreat necessary, as while
    we retreated to our old position, the enemy was also in full
    retreat. <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>I shall say no more
    of the expedition to Holland, as what remains to be added, you
    will see fully detailed in the papers. I go to Norwich, where
    the regiment is quartered, this evening. Another expedition is
    talked of, under Lord Moira. Adieu."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the battle of Egmont-op-Zee, seven pieces of cannon, a
  great number of tumbrils, and a few hundred prisoners, were
  taken, and the loss of the enemy was estimated as exceeding 4,000
  men. Major-General Moore, in whose brigade was the 49th, although
  severely wounded through the thigh, continued in action for
  nearly two hours, until a second wound in the face obliged him to
  quit the field. In his dispatch relative to this battle, the Duke
  of York observed, that "under Divine Providence this signal
  victory obtained over the enemy, is to be attributed to the
  animating and persevering exertions which have at all times been
  the characteristics of the British soldier, and which on no
  occasion were ever more eminently displayed." The following
  extract from this dispatch, dated Alkmaar, 6th of October, will
  shew the part borne in the engagement by Sir Ralph Abercromby's
  division, in which was Major-General Moore's brigade.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"This was the last event which took place on the side of
    Bergen; and, as the close of the day was fast approaching,
    Colonel Macdonald with two battalions was sent to the support
    of General Sir Ralph Abercromby. The heights of the sand hills,
    surrounding Bergen for about three miles, remained crowned and
    possessed by <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>about eleven
    British battalions. General Sir Ralph Abercromby had marched,
    according to the disposition, along the beach, with
    Major-General D'Oyley's, Major-General Moore's, and Major
    General Lord Cavan's brigades, the cavalry and horse artillery,
    (the reserve under Colonel Macdonald not having been able,
    owing to the great extent of the sand hills, to rejoin him,
    after turning to the left at Campe.) The main body of Sir Ralph
    Abercromby's column had proceeded, without meeting with much
    resistance, in the early part of the day, but was nevertheless
    much inconvenienced, and his troops harassed, by the necessity
    of detaching continually into the sand hills to his left, to
    cover that flank against the troops whom the enemy had placed
    in the sand hills. The admirable disposition, however, which he
    made of his troops, and their determined spirit and gallantry,
    enabled him to arrive within a mile of Egmont. Here he was
    seriously opposed by a very considerable corps of French
    infantry, which occupied Egmont-op-Zee, and the high sand hills
    in its front, and who had formed a very strong corps of cavalry
    and artillery to their left. The engagement was maintained
    during several hours with the greatest obstinacy; and in no
    instance were the abilities of a commander, or the heroic
    perseverance of troops in so difficult and trying a situation,
    more highly conspicuous. Animated by the example of General Sir
    Ralph Abercromby, and the generals and officers under him, the
    troops sustained every effort made upon them by an enemy then
    superior in numbers, and much favoured by the strength of his
    position. Late in the evening, the enemy's cavalry, having been
    defeated in an attempt which they made upon the British horse
    artillery on the beach, and having been charged by the cavalry
    under Colonel Lord Paget, was driven, with considerable loss,
    nearly to Egmont-op-Zee; his efforts then relaxed considerably
    on the right; and General Sir Ralph Abercromby, having soon
    after been joined by the reinforcements under Colo<a name=
    "Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>nel Macdonald, took post upon the
    sand hills and the beach, within a very short distance of
    Egmont-op-Zee, where the troops lay upon their arms during the
    night."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the battle of the 6th of October, in which the 49th was not
  engaged, the English and Russians, after gaining some advantage,
  were suddenly charged by the enemy's cavalry and separated, so
  that they could neither support each other nor retain the ground
  which they had gained. The allied armies were repulsed beyond
  Baccum, after having sustained a very severe loss; and as they
  were unable either to advance or to draw any resources from the
  country in their possession, their supplies were necessarily
  obtained from the fleet. The Duke of York, therefore, assembled a
  council of war, whose decision was, that the allied forces should
  fall back and wait the instructions of the British Government. As
  the season was so far advanced, as the approach of winter was
  daily making the navigation of the coast more dangerous, and as
  there was no time to effect diversions or to change the plan of
  operations, the Duke of York was ordered to evacuate the country.
  In the meanwhile, as the English and Russians concentrated
  themselves behind their entrenchments at the Zyp, the enemy
  pressed upon them, and the Duke of York sent a flag of truce to
  General Brune, proposing a capitulation on the basis of an
  armistice, or of the free embarkation of his army. This was
  agreed to at Alkmaar, on the 18th of October, and thus ended this
  memorable expedi<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>tion, the most
  considerable that had been attempted in modern times up to that
  period. As the introduction of foreign troops into England was
  prohibited by the Bill of Rights, the Russians were sent to the
  islands of Jersey and Guernsey, the season not admitting of their
  return home. About 6,000 were quartered in the latter island,
  where a disease, contracted by exposure to the marshy grounds of
  Holland, carried off some hundreds, who were buried at the foot
  of the hill on which stands Vale Castle, and where their graves
  are still to be seen. Their conduct in Guernsey was at first
  peaceable and orderly;&mdash;the inhabitants were surprised at
  seeing them eat the grease from the cart wheels, and they were
  also excessively fond of ardent spirits; and, having plenty of
  money, they indulged in them freely, swallowing large draughts in
  a raw state. But in June, 1800, while the transports were in the
  roads to convey them to Russia, a soldier, who was robbing
  vegetables on a small farm, which had been frequently plundered
  by his comrades before, was fired at and wounded by the
  proprietor. This so exasperated the whole body, that fears were
  entertained of their revenging themselves on the inhabitants
  generally; and as the British garrison was very small, it
  required all the tact and conciliation of the
  lieutenant-governor, Sir Hew Dalrymple, to prevent an outbreak.
  The Russians embarked, but the guns at Castle Cornet were kept
  shotted to prevent their relanding.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
  "FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
  "fnanchor">[13]</a> <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>The 49th,
  on the return of the expedition from Holland, after remaining a
  short time in England, was again quartered in Jersey, where the
  fine person and manly bearing of Lieut.-Colonel Brock are still
  favorably remembered. In return for the many attentions which he
  and his officers received in that island, he obtained an ensigncy
  in his own regiment for a young man resident there, whom he
  afterwards pushed forward in the service, and who died recently a
  major-general and a companion of the bath. Early in the year
  1801, the 49th was embarked in the fleet destined for the Baltic,
  under Sir Hyde Parker; and Lieut.-Colonel Brock was second in
  command of the land forces at the memorable attack of Copenhagen,
  by Lord Nelson, on the 2d of April. He was appointed to lead the
  49th in storming the principal of the Treckroner batteries, in
  conjunction with five hundred seamen, under Captain
  Fremantle,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
  "FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
  "fnanchor">[14]</a> of the Ganges, of 74 guns; but the protracted
  and heroic defence of the Danes rendering the attempt
  impracticable, Colonel Brock, during the hard-fought battle,
  remained on board the Ganges; and at its close he accompanied
  Captain Fremantle to the Elephant, 74, Nelson's flag ship, where
  he saw the hero<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id=
  "FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class=
  "fnanchor">[15]</a> write his celebrated letter to the Crown
  Prince of Denmark. Savery Brock was also on board the Ganges, and
  while in the act of pointing one of her quarter <a name="Page_22"
  id="Page_22"></a>deck guns, his cocked hat was torn from his head
  by a grape shot: a naval officer, who was present, afterwards
  described the scene which followed this narrow escape in these
  words: "I now hear Sir Isaac exclaim, 'Ah! poor Savery is dead!'
  But Savery was not an instant on his back; in the same moment he
  rubbed his head, assured his brother that he was not injured, and
  fired the gun with as much coolness as if nothing had happened."
  The effect of the shot passing so near him was such that,
  although a remarkably powerful young man, six feet two inches in
  height, he was knocked down and stunned for the moment. Of the
  49th, Captain Sharp was badly wounded on board of the Bellona,
  and Lieutenant Dennis was wounded on board of the Monarch, which
  ship had 55 killed and 155 wounded, exclusive of officers, but
  including 8 soldiers of the 49th killed, and 20 wounded. In
  addition to the 49th was a detachment of the 95th,
  rifles&mdash;consisting, we believe, of two companies&mdash;under
  Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable William Stewart,<a name=
  "FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> who was senior
  officer of the troops embarked. As such his name was included in
  the thanks of Parliament; but we cannot understand why a
  lieutenant-colonel, with only two companies, was placed over the
  head of an officer of equal rank with his entire regiment, unless
  indeed the cause was that Lieut.-Colonel Brock was not an
  "honorable!" We are not <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>aware
  that he ever complained of what appears to us to have been an act
  of injustice to him, and we may therefore be wrong in our view of
  the subject. The British loss, in killed and wounded, was 953, or
  58 more than fell at the battle of the Nile. In mentioning the
  loss at Copenhagen, Southey, in his admirable Life of Nelson,
  says, on what authority we know not: "Part of this slaughter
  might have been spared. The commanding officer of the troops on
  board one of our ships, asked where his men should be stationed?
  He was told that they could be of no use; that they were not near
  enough for musquetry, and were not wanted at the guns; they had,
  therefore, better go below. This, he said, was
  impossible&mdash;it would be a disgrace that could never be wiped
  away. They were, therefore, drawn up upon the gangway, to satisfy
  this cruel point of honor; and there, without the possibility of
  annoying the enemy, they were mowed down! The loss of the Danes,
  including prisoners, amounted to about 6,000."</p>

  <p>John Savery Brock, of whose gallantry mention is made in the
  preceding pages, was the next younger brother of Lieut.-Colonel
  Brock, and had been in the navy; but it being supposed that he
  was influential, in the year 1790, in inducing his brother
  midshipmen, of the fleet at Spithead, to sign a round robin
  against their being subjected to the practice of
  mast-heading&mdash;one having been hoisted up to the gaff end in
  an ignominous manner, because he refused to go to the mast head
  as <a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>a punishment&mdash;he was
  recommended privately to retire from the service.<a name=
  "FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Being at this time a
  tall and high spirited young man of eighteen, it is not
  surprising that he deemed such a punishment unnecessarily
  degrading to the feelings of an officer, and which has since been
  very properly abolished. Had it not been for this circumstance,
  it is the opinion of a naval officer of high rank, that Savery
  Brock would have distinguished himself and risen to eminence in
  the navy during the late revolutionary wars. Some little time
  after this affair, being in Guernsey, he wished to go to England,
  and was offered a passage in the Amazon, frigate, Captain
  Reynolds, afterwards Rear-Admiral Reynolds, who perished in the
  St. George, of 98 guns, on her return from the Baltic, in 1811.
  The Amazon, bound to Portsmouth, left the roadstead late in the
  afternoon, and before she was clear of the small Russel&mdash;a
  dangerous passage&mdash;night overtook her. By some accident the
  pilot mistook the bearings, owing to the darkness and thick
  weather. Savery Brock, being acquainted with the intricate
  course, was on the fore yard looking out, when he suddenly espied
  some rocks towards which the frigate was steering. There was no
  time for communication, and, without hesitating an instant, he
  cried <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>out in true nautical
  style: "H-a-r-d up, h-a-r-d up." "H-a-r-d up it is," replied the
  helmsman. "H-a-r-d up," repeated Savery in a louder key. "Gently,
  young man," said the captain, who was standing forward. The ship
  fortunately bore away just in time to clear the rocks, and was
  thus saved by the prompt interference of her passenger. We have
  often heard him in his latter days tell the story with excusable
  pride, and he especially remembered how the crew pointed him out
  the next morning to each other, as the young man who had got the
  ship out of her danger. As he was without employment, his brother
  Isaac subsequently procured him the paymastership of the 49th,
  which he retained only three or four years, the office being one
  quite unfitted to his previous education and active mind. In
  1808, his military zeal induced him to serve for a short time as
  an amateur aide-de-camp to Sir John Moore, on the Peninsula. He
  married and settled in Guernsey; and whether as a militia
  colonel, or in the exercise of a generous hospitality, or, above
  all, as a projector and zealous promoter of many public
  improvements in his native island, his memory will long live in
  the recollection of its inhabitants.</p>

  <p>When Kean performed in Guernsey, two or three years before his
  appearance on the London boards, Savery Brock was enthusiastic in
  his admiration, and predicted the future eminence of that
  celebrated tragedian, in whose memoirs his name is gratefully
  mentioned.</p>

  id="Page_28"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p>The 49th, on its return from Copenhagen to England, was
  collected at Colchester, and in the spring following, (1802,) the
  regiment sailed for Canada, which country was destined to bestow
  on it many additional laurels, as well as to be the scene of the
  fame and death of its commanding officer. In less than eighteen
  months after the arrival of the 49th in Canada, and while it was
  quartered in the upper province, a serious conspiracy was on the
  point of breaking out in that part of the regiment which was in
  garrison at Fort George, on the Niagara, under the command of the
  junior lieutenant-colonel, the head quarters being, we believe,
  at York, the capital. This officer, it seems, more by useless
  annoyance than by actual severity, had exasperated the men under
  his command to that degree that they formed a plot to murder all
  the officers present, with the exception of a young man who had
  recently joined; and then to cross over to the United States. Far
  be it from us to justify the intention, which indeed was highly
  criminal; but in all such extreme cases we hold that a sad abuse
  of power, or a gross want of tact, must be the exciting cause,
  and that even in the passive obedience of a military life, there
  may be a limit to human endurance. The proximity of the United
  States rendered this plot a very feasible one, as the men in a
  body could have crossed the river Niagara without molestation or
  difficulty. The suspicions of the officer in command having been
  aroused, he hastily wrote to Lieut.-Colonel Brock on the subject,
  and sent his letter by one of the men, who delivered it as the
  latter officer was shooting, or on his return from a shooting
  excursion. On reading the letter, and knowing from the character
  of the man that he must be engaged in the conspiracy, if there
  were any, he threatened to shoot him on the spot, if he did not
  instantly divulge the names of the ringleaders. The man, thus
  taken by surprise, did as he was ordered, and Lieut.-Colonel
  Brock hurried off to Fort George. On his arrival he found the men
  at dinner, and placing the officers with their drawn swords at
  the doors, he went into the rooms with handcuffs, and secured the
  most culpable, among whom was a sergeant, none offering the
  slightest resistance. The ringleaders were immediately embarked,
  so as to prevent any attempt at their rescue.<a name=
  "FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> On being tried by a
  court martial, four were condemned to suffer death, and, with
  three deserters, were shot at Quebec, in presence of the
  garrison, early in the month of March, 1804. A most awful and
  affecting sight it was: the wind was easterly, strong, and
  cold,&mdash;a thick drift of snow added to the gloom,&mdash;and,
  as if to increase the horror of the scene, a few of the firing
  party, fifty-six in number, instead of advancing to within eight
  yards of the prisoners, as was intended, owing to some mistake
  commenced firing at the distance of at least fifty yards. The
  consequence was, that the unhappy wretches were only partially
  wounded, and dropped one after another. Nearly forty shots were
  fired before one poor fellow in the centre fell, although he was
  wounded through the abdomen at the first discharge. The men who
  had reserved their fire, were at length ordered up, and, lodging
  the contents of their muskets in the breasts of the culprits, by
  that means put them out of torture. The unfortunate sufferers
  declared publicly that, had they continued under the command of
  Colonel Brock, they would have escaped their melancholy end; and,
  as may be easily conceived, he felt no little anguish that they,
  who had so recently and so bravely fought under him in Holland
  and at Copenhagen, were thus doomed to end their lives, the
  victims of unruly passions inflamed by vexatious authority. He
  was now directed to assume the command at Fort George, and all
  complaint and desertion instantly ceased.</p>

  <p>In the fall of 1805, in October of which year he was made a
  full colonel, Colonel Brock returned to Europe on leave; and
  early in the following year, he laid before his royal highness
  the <a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>commander-in-chief the
  outlines of a plan for the formation of a veteran battalion, to
  serve in the Canadas. In support of the plan he wrote:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"The advantages which may attend the establishment of a
    corps such as is here recommended, will be perhaps more clearly
    understood by first adverting to some of the causes that
    produce the inconvenience to which the troops occupying the
    frontier posts of that country are continually exposed.</p>

    <p>"A regiment quartered in Upper Canada is generally divided
    into eight different parts, several hundred miles asunder, and
    in this situation it remains at least three years. Great as is
    the evil incidental to a state of separation, even where the
    mind is in no danger of being debauched, what may not be
    apprehended in a country where both the divided state of the
    regiment, and the artifices employed to wean the soldier from
    his duty, conspire to render almost ineffectual every effort of
    the officers to maintain the usual degree of order and
    discipline. The lures to desertion continually thrown out by
    the Americans, and the facility with which it can be
    accomplished, exacting a more than ordinary precaution on the
    part of the officers, insensibly produce mistrust between them
    and the men, highly prejudicial to the service.</p>

    <p>"Experience has taught me that no regular regiment, however
    high its claim to discipline, can occupy the frontier posts of
    Lower and Upper Canada without suffering materially in its
    num<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>bers. It might have been
    otherwise some years ago; but now that the country,
    particularly the opposite shore, is chiefly inhabited by the
    vilest characters, who have an interest in debauching the
    soldier from his duty; since roads are opened into the interior
    of the States, which facilitate desertion, it is impossible to
    avoid the contagion. A total change must be effected in the
    minds and views of those who may hereafter be sent on this
    duty, before the evil can be surmounted."</p>
  </div>

  <p>In a letter from Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, dated Horse Guards,
  January 17, 1806, Colonel Brock received the Duke of York's
  "thanks for the communication of his very sensible observations
  respecting the distribution of the troops in Canada, which his
  royal highness will not fail to take into consideration at a
  seasonable opportunity."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id=
  "FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class=
  "fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>While on a visit to his family and friends in Guernsey,
  Colonel Brock deemed the intelligence from the United States to
  be of so warlike a character, that he resolved on returning to
  Canada before his leave was expired; and such was his anxiety to
  be at his post, that he overtook at Cork the Lady Saumarez, a
  Guernsey vessel, well manned and armed as a letter of marque,
  bound to Quebec. He left London on the 26th June, 1806, and
  hurried away from Europe never to return&mdash;never to revisit
  those who fondly loved him, not only from ties of kindred, but
  for his many endearing quali<a name="Page_31" id=
  "Page_31"></a>ties; but he had the satisfaction of knowing that
  the commander-in-chief was much pleased with the zeal and
  devotion evinced by him on this occasion.</p>

  <p>Soon after his arrival in Canada, Colonel Brock succeeded, on
  the 27th September, 1806, to the command of the troops in the two
  provinces, Colonel Bowes<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id=
  "FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class=
  "fnanchor">[20]</a> having resigned that command on his departure
  for England. At this time, the civil government of the lower
  province was administered by Mr. President Dunn, and Colonel
  Brock resided at Quebec, in command of the forces, until the
  arrival of the governor-general, Sir James Craig, in October,
  1807, who appointed him to act as a brigadier, which appointment
  was confirmed by the king, to date from the 2d of July, 1808.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to Lieut.-Colonel J.W. Gordon.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, September 28, 1806.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to acquaint you, for the information of the
    commander-in-chief, that Colonel Bowes, preparatory to his
    departure for England, has resigned the command of his
    majesty's forces in this country, which, as the next senior
    officer, devolves on me.</p>

    <p>I find great pleasure in reporting to his royal highness the
    good order and discipline which, much to the credit of
    Lieut.-Colonel Sheaffe, I <a name="Page_32" id=
    "Page_32"></a>found on my arrival to prevail among the eight
    companies of the 49th regiment, quartered in this garrison.</p>

    <p>It has been the fate of the 49th to be divided, for the last
    four years and a half, several hundred miles apart, and however
    anxious I must be to assemble the whole together, I have not,
    considering the youth of the 100th regiment, which alone
    affords me the means of effecting that measure, thought it
    prudent to withdraw the company stationed at St. John's and the
    other frontier posts of this province, but the one at Montreal
    will be relieved this autumn.</p>

    <p>Colonel Bowes having complied with Lieut.-Colonel Otway's
    earnest application for leave to return to England, I have
    appointed Captain Ormsby, of the 49th regiment, an officer of
    approved merit, to act as deputy adjutant-general during his
    absence; an arrangement which, I presume to hope, his royal
    highness will be graciously pleased to sanction.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to the Right Hon. W. Windham.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, February 12, 1807.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to transmit for your consideration a
    proposal of Lieut.-Colonel John M'Donald, late of the Royal
    Canadian Volunteers, for raising a corps among the Scotch
    settlers in the county of Glengary, Upper Canada.</p>

    <p>When it is considered that both the Canadas furnish only two
    hundred militia who are trained <a name="Page_33" id=
    "Page_33"></a>to arms, the advantages to be derived from such
    an establishment must appear very, evident.</p>

    <p>The military force in this country is very small, and were
    it possible to collect it in time to oppose any serious attempt
    upon Quebec, the only tenable post, the number would of itself
    be insufficient to ensure a vigorous defence.</p>

    <p>This corps, being stationed on the confines of the Lower
    Province, would be always immediately and essentially useful in
    checking any seditious disposition, which the wavering
    sentiments of a large population in the Montreal district might
    at any time manifest. In the event of invasion, or other
    emergency, this force could be easily and expeditiously
    transported by water to Quebec.</p>

    <p>The extent of country which these settlers occupy, would
    make the permanent establishment of the staff and one sergeant
    in each company very advisable. I shall not presume to say how
    far the claims of the field officers to the same indulgence are
    reasonable and expedient.</p>

    <p>In regard to the Rev. Alexander M'Donald, I beg leave to
    observe, that the men being all Catholics, it may be deemed a
    prudent measure to appoint him chaplain. His zeal and
    attachment to Government were strongly evinced whilst filling
    the office of chaplain to the Glengary Fencibles during the
    rebellion in Ireland, and were graciously acknowledged by his
    royal highness the commander-in-chief.</p>

    <p>His influence over the men is deservedly great, <a name=
    "Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>and I have every reason to think
    that the corps, by his exertions, would be soon completed, and
    hereafter become a nursery from which the army might draw a
    number of hardy recruits.</p>

  <p>The following letter affords a good idea of the confidential
  report of a general officer on the state of a regiment after its
  periodical inspection.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to the Adjutant-General of His Majesty's
  Forces.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, March 17, 1807.</p>

    <p>In obedience to the commander-in-chief's commands,
    communicated to me in your letter dated 20th November last, I
    shall proceed to state, for His Royal Highness's information,
    such observations as a strict attention to the conduct and
    interior economy of the 100th<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id=
    "FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class=
    "fnanchor">[21]</a> regiment during the preceding six months
    has enabled me to make.</p>

    <p>The greatest praise is justly due to Lieut.-Colonel Murray,
    who has commanded, with only a short interval, from the first
    formation of the regiment to the present time, for his
    unremitting care and attention to the several important duties
    of his office.</p>

    <p>The good effects of his exertions and intelligence are
    strikingly visible in every department of the corps. He has
    been ably supported by Major <a name="Page_35" id=
    "Page_35"></a>Hamilton and the rest of his officers, who on all
    occasions evince the utmost zeal for the service, and the
    highest respect and attachment towards his person. He has
    succeeded in establishing an interior discipline and economy,
    which I have never before witnessed in so young a corps, and
    scarcely seen surpassed by any, and in a way too the most
    satisfactory to the feelings of an officer.</p>

    <p>Although I trust the garrison duty at Quebec is carried on
    with every regard to the safety of the place, together with the
    strictest attention to all prescribed forms and regulations,
    yet the winter has nearly passed without a single instance of
    neglect or misconduct having occurred among the 100th regiment;
    and it is a pleasing task to report, that so exemplarily have
    the men behaved, that, even regimentally, only one corporal
    punishment has been inflicted for the last three months.</p>

    <p>I am now speaking of men who, being nearly all Irish, are of
    all others the most volatile and easily led astray. Should
    they, therefore, hereafter be seduced by the various
    temptations by which they are surrounded, I hope to escape the
    imputation of judging too hastily and partially. The men were
    principally raised in the north of Ireland, and are nearly all
    Protestants; they are robust, active, and good looking.</p>

    <p>The troops in this country are precluded, by the severity of
    the climate during seven months in the year, from exercising
    out of doors: it cannot, therefore, be expected that the 100th
    regiment <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>can, considering
    the little practice it has had in the field, and after such a
    long interval, be very expert in its manoeuvres; but as
    Lieut.-Colonel Murray possesses both capacity and inclination,
    and as a good foundation is already laid, the most rapid
    progress may be expected so soon as the season enables him to
    commence his labours.</p>

    <p>A large room has been allotted in the barracks to the
    purposes of drilling with arms, from which the garrison has
    derived essential benefit.</p>

    <p>The clothing for the present year is all fitted, and appears
    very good. Every man is provided with a great coat, agreeably
    to His Majesty's regulations; but as the great coat is
    necessarily worn on all occasions for six months in the year,
    it cannot by the strictest economy be made to last the
    specified time. Those of the 100th have been two years in wear,
    and are so far expended, that they will become wholly
    unserviceable before next winter. I know of no other
    alternative but supplying others at the charge of the men,
    which opinion I have given to Lieut.-Colonel Murray, who
    applied to me on the subject.</p>

    <p>The messes have been all along abundantly provided. Indeed,
    the soldiers in this country live in a perfect state of luxury
    unknown any where else.</p>

    <p>The non-commissioned officers and privates acknowledge to
    have received every thing which is their due in respect to pay
    and clothing. One man claims a part of his bounty, which, he
    says, has been withheld. A regimental court martial <a name=
    "Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>has already decided against him, but
    the business shall again be investigated by a garrison court
    martial.</p>

    <p>Lieut.-Colonel Murray has reported to me, that there are
    several men in his regiment who claim bounty, but as only one
    complained at the inspection, the remainder must be satisfied
    that he is doing his utmost to recover what is actually their
    due.</p>

    <p>The hospital is in as complete order as the house which has
    been hired for that purpose can admit. Indeed, the troops in
    garrison are much inconvenienced for want of permanent
    hospitals. There were three cases of fever; the remainder of
    the patients were chiefly attacked with a disease too prevalent
    among young soldiers. Three men are unfit for service, being
    frost-bitten.</p>

    <p>The men are supplied with necessaries in conformity to his
    majesty's regulations.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to the Adjutant-General of His Majesty's
  Forces.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, July 1, 1807.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to transmit herewith the inspection return
    of the 41st regiment for two distinct periods, viz. September
    1, 1806, and March 1, 1807.</p>

    <p>Some inaccuracies being found in the September return
    previously received, it was sent back to Lieut.-Colonel
    Proctor, at Fort George, for correction. This circumstance and
    the distance of the place, account for the delay which has
    oc<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>curred in complying, in
    the present instance, with the commands of his royal highness
    the commander-in-chief.</p>

    <p>The very great distance of the quarters the 41st now occupy,
    has prevented my making personally the periodical inspection of
    that regiment required by my instructions. But its dispersed
    state and the many evils by which it is surrounded will,
    however great the zeal and intelligence of Lieut.-Colonel
    Proctor and the other officers, so far affect the discipline
    and morals of the men, as to justify my saying that both the
    one and the other must, without the possibility of a remedy,
    progressively suffer in proportion as the regiment remains
    stationed in the Upper Province. The 41st regiment, having a
    considerable number of old soldiers, is better calculated for
    that service than either the 49th or 100th regiments, and no
    change is therefore meditated.</p>

    <p>Not being possessed with the means of making a more
    circumstantial report of the state of the 41st regiment, I have
    only to add, in justice to the officers commanding posts, that
    they evince in their communications with head quarters much
    attention and sound judgment.</p>

    <p>Contemplating the probable arrival of a general officer by
    the fleet daily expected from England, I have so far presumed
    to deviate from my instructions as to postpone making the
    periodical inspection of the regiments quartered in this
    garrison, conceiving that his royal highness the
    commander-<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>in-chief would
    esteem a report coming from such a high source more
    satisfactory, than if I were to undertake the task in my
    present situation, which may naturally be supposed, in some
    degree, to bias my judgment.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>On the 17th July, 1807, in consequence of an expected rupture
  between England and the United States, Colonel Brock addressed a
  letter to Mr. President Dunn, in which he said that the number of
  militia armed and instructed in the province did not exceed 300,
  while he thought that as many thousands could easily, and with
  perfect safety, be formed into corps; and that Quebec, the only
  military post in the country, was not in a condition to make much
  defence against an active enemy, as the walls on the western side
  were old and decayed, and could not possibly sustain a continued
  heavy fire. He added, that he wished to throw up such works as
  would remedy this glaring defect; but as the garrison was totally
  inadequate to such an undertaking, he required from 600 to 1,000
  men every day for six weeks or two months, besides a vast number
  of carts, &amp;c., to complete the necessary defences of the
  citadel. This letter being submitted to the council, that body
  replied, that the only means by which assistance could be given
  by the civil government to the military, in the manner proposed
  by Colonel Brock, would be by embodying a proportion of the
  militia according to law, the men for which service must be
  <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>taken from different parts of
  the province. And that as this measure had only once before been
  resorted to in the province, on which occasion a decided
  disobedience was generally manifested, and was again to be
  anticipated, the council inquired of Colonel Brock whether he had
  the means, and would furnish them, to enforce the attendance of
  the militia, who, when embodied, were entitled to the same pay
  and allowances as the king's troops. The council further informed
  Colonel Brock that it would meet again the next day, for the
  purpose of taking into consideration any representation, in
  writing, which he might think proper to make in answer to their
  communication, and that, if convenient to him, they requested his
  personal attendance. His reply was as follows:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, 23d July, 1807.</p>

    <p>Colonel Brock has perused with attention the proceedings of
    his honor the president in council, communicated to him by Mr.
    Ryland, and begs leave to observe, that in addressing his honor
    on the 17th instant, it was far from his intention to assume a
    political character.</p>

    <p>His sole object was to state the assistance required by the
    military to remedy a glaring defect in the fortifications of
    Quebec, should his honor conceive that preparatory measures
    were necessary to be adopted in consequence of the event which
    recently occurred between his majesty's ship Leopard and the
    American frigate Chesapeake, but <a name="Page_41" id=
    "Page_41"></a>more particularly the subsequent aggressive
    provisions contained in the proclamation of the American
    government.</p>

    <p>In thus complying with the dictates of his duty, Colonel
    Brock was not prepared to hear that the population of the
    province, instead of affording him ready and effectual support,
    might probably add to the number of his enemies; and he feels
    much disappointment in being informed by the first authority,
    that the only law in any degree calculated to answer the end
    proposed was likely, if attempted to be enforced, to meet with
    such general opposition as to require the aid of the military
    to give it even a momentary impulse.</p>

    <p>Colonel Brock is therefore obliged to observe, that the
    officer commanding certainly would not choose the time when the
    troops may every instant be called upon for the defence of
    Quebec, to disperse them over the country in aid of the civil
    government, coercively collecting a body of men, which, under
    such circumstances, would be of more detriment than service to
    the regular army. Colonel Brock cannot, therefore, look for any
    assistance from that quarter, but, should an emergency arise,
    he is confident that voluntary offers of service will be made
    by a considerable number of brave and loyal subjects, and feels
    himself justified in saying, that even now several gentlemen
    are ready to come forward and enroll into companies men on
    whose fidelity they can safely rely.</p>

    <p>It remains with his honor to determine the <a name="Page_42"
    id="Page_42"></a>degree of countenance which ought to be given
    to such sentiments.</p>

    <p>Colonel Brock will be at all times proud to attend
    deliberations of his honor in council.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to Lord Viscount Castlereagh.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, July 25, 1807.</p>

    <p>I think it my duty to transmit for your lordship's
    information a copy of the communication that has passed between
    his honor the president and me, relative to the military
    situation of this country.</p>

    <p>Your Lordship will perceive from the minutes of the council,
    how very inadequate the militia law is to afford assistance to
    the regular force, and the degree of dependance that may be
    placed on the population of this province.</p>

    <p>My own observations, however, enable me to assure your
    Lordship, that a respectable force might be trained and
    rendered exceedingly useful on any exigency, were the least
    encouragement given to the spirit which at present pervades a
    certain class to volunteer their services.</p>

    <p>To such characters arms might be safely entrusted, but I
    certainly would consider an indiscriminate distribution to the
    militia, were it possible to collect it, as highly imprudent
    and dangerous.</p>

    <p>What I stated to his honor the president respecting the
    weakness of the works along the whole of the west front of this
    garrison, is consonant to the opinion transmitted by the
    officers of engineers <a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>and
    artillery, in their half-yearly periodical report, to the
    master-general of the ordnance.</p>

    <p>To a question from the president, viz. "Should the council
    conceive it necessary to call out the militia, whether I
    thought myself warranted to issue pay and provisions to them?"
    I answered, Certainly not: that in all British Colonies, of
    which I had any knowledge, they on all such occasions defrayed
    their own expenses.</p>

    <p>The consideration that there is about &pound;30,000 in the
    civil chest, which cannot be applied to its object until next
    spring, and the ease with which the error I may have fallen
    into might be remedied, induced me to be so positive upon a
    subject, regarding which I am without instructions.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Brock to Lieut.-Colonel J.W. Gordon.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, Sept. 6, 1807.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to view the late hostile measures of the
    American government towards England, without considering a
    rupture between the two countries as probable to happen.</p>

    <p>I have in consequence been anxious that such precautionary
    measures might be taken as the case seemed to justify; but his
    honor the president has not judged it proper to adopt any other
    step, than merely to order one-fifth of the militia, which
    amounts to about 10,000 men, to hold itself in readiness to
    march on the shortest notice.</p>

    <p>The men thus selected for service being scattered along an
    extensive line of four or five hun<a name="Page_44" id=
    "Page_44"></a>dred miles, unarmed and totally unacquainted with
    every thing military, without officers capable of giving them
    instruction, considerable time would naturally be required
    before the necessary degree of order and discipline could be
    introduced among them. I therefore very much doubt whether, in
    the event of actual war, this force could assemble in time, and
    become useful.</p>

    <p>Without considerable assistance from the militia, the few
    regulars which might be spared from this garrison could avail
    nothing against the force the Americans would suddenly
    introduce by various roads into this province.</p>

    <p>The Canadians have unquestionably shewn a great willingness
    upon this occasion to be trained, and, I make not the least
    doubt, would oppose with vigour any invasion of the
    Americans&mdash;but how far the same sentiments would actuate
    them were a French force to join, I will not undertake to say;
    at any rate, I feel that every consideration of prudence and
    policy ought to determine me to keep in Quebec a sufficient
    force to secure its safety; the number of troops that could
    therefore be safely detached would be small, notwithstanding a
    great deal might be done, in conjunction with the militia, in a
    country intersected in every direction by rivers, deep ravines,
    and lined, at intervals on both sides the road, by thick
    woods.</p>

    <p>From every information I can receive, the Americans are
    busily employed in drilling and forming their militia, and
    openly declare their intention of <a name="Page_45" id=
    "Page_45"></a>entering this province the instant war is
    determined upon; they will be encouraged to adopt this step
    from the very defenceless state of our frontiers; the means at
    my disposal are too limited to oppose them with effect in the
    open field, and I shall be constrained, unless his honor the
    president make exertions, which I do not think him at this
    moment disposed to do, to confine myself to the defence of
    Quebec.</p>

    <p>I have hastened the completion of the works which enclose
    the upper town of Quebec, and I have thought myself justified
    in causing a battery of eight 36-pounders to be raised sixteen
    feet upon the cavalier in the centre of the citadel, which will
    effectually command the opposite heights.</p>

    <p>Although these remarks may be premature, I yet conceive it
    my duty to give his royal highness the commander-in-chief a
    view of my real situation.</p>

    <p>I must freely confess that I am unable to account for the
    motives which seem at present to guide the councils of this
    province. Voluntary offers of service have been made by
    numbers, on whose loyalty the utmost reliance can be placed, to
    form themselves into corps of cavalry, artillery, and infantry,
    at little or no expense to government, provided they were
    furnished with arms; but this liberal spirit has not been
    encouraged by the president.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to report, that at a recent interview I had
    at Montreal with Lieut.-Governor Gore, it was judged expedient
    that his excellency <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>should
    assume the command in the upper province. I regretted
    exceedingly that I could not, with propriety, detach troops in
    support of the spirited exertions whioh will be immediately
    made to place that country in a respectable state of defence.
    He has been supplied with four thousand muskets from the king's
    arsenal at Quebec, and with various military stores of which he
    stood in need: this leaves in my possession only seven thousand
    muskets for the use of the militia of this province, and to
    supply, as far as they will go, every other emergency.</p>

  <p><i>Brigadier Brock to his Brothers</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, July 20, 1808.</p>

    <p>I have written to all of you since the navigation opened,
    and the only letters I have received from any of the family for
    several months came from Irving, who, to do him justice, is
    infinitely the most attentive and regular correspondent among
    you.</p>

    <p>My appointment to be brigadier I first announced by the
    March mail. Those who feel an interest in my prosperity will
    rejoice in my good fortune, as this distinguished mark of favor
    affords undeniable proof that my conduct, during the period of
    my command, was approved;&mdash;a great gratification,
    considering the many difficulties I had to encounter. I once
    thought I should be ordered to the upper province, but General
    Ferguson being among the newly appointed major-generals, will
    not now probably visit this country. In that case, I stand a
    very good chance of succeeding him, both in rank and in the
    command of Quebec, where it was intended he should be
    stationed.</p>

    <p>What will be the result of our present unsettled relations
    with the neighbouring republic, it is very <a name="Page_48"
    id="Page_48"></a>difficult to say. The government is composed
    of such unprincipled men, that to calculate on it by the
    ordinary rules of action would be perfectly absurd. We have
    completely outwitted Jefferson in all his schemes to provoke us
    to war. He had no other view in issuing his restrictive
    proclamation; but, failing in that, he tried what the embargo
    would produce, and there he has been foiled again. Certainly,
    our administration is deserving of every praise for their
    policy on these occasions. Jefferson and his party, however
    strong the inclination, dare not declare war, and therefore
    they endeavour to attain their object by every provocation. A
    few weeks since, the garrison of Niagara fired upon seven
    merchant boats passing the fort, and actually captured them.
    Considering the circumstances attending this hostile act, it is
    but too evident it was intended to provoke retaliation: these
    boats fired upon and taken within musket shot of our own fort;
    their balls falling on our shore, was expected to have raised
    the indignation of the most phlegmatic; fortunately, the
    commandant was not in the way, as otherwise it is difficult to
    say what would have happened. A representation of this affair
    has been made at Washington, and, for an act certainly opposed
    to existing treaties, we have been referred for justice to the
    ordinary course of the law! If our subjects cannot command
    impunity from capture under the guns of our own forts, it were
    better to demolish them at once rather than witness and suffer
    such <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>indignity. By the
    treaties which have expired, the navigation of the waters that

    still in force, although every other part should cease to be
    obligatory.</p>

    <p>I get on here pretty well, but this place loses at this
    season the undoubted advantage it possesses over Quebec in
    winter. Great additions are making to the fortifications at
    Quebec, and, when completed, the Americans will, if I mistake
    not, think it prudent not to trouble the place, for they can
    have no chance of making any impression upon it during the
    short period which the severity of the climate only permits an
    enemy to lay before it. I erected, as I believe I told you
    before, a famous battery, which the public voice named after
    me; but Sir James, thinking very properly that any thing so
    very pre-eminent should be distinguished by the most exalted
    appellation, has called it the King's Battery, the greatest
    compliment, I conceive, that he could pay to my
    judgment.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=

    "fnanchor">[22]</a> Not a desertion has been attempted by any
    of the 49th for the last ten months, with the exception indeed
    of Hogan, Savery's former servant. He served Glegg in the same
    capacity, who took him with him to the Falls of Niagara, where
    a fair damsel persuaded him to this act of madness, for the
    fellow cannot possibly gain his bread by labour, as he has half
    killed himself with excessive <a name="Page_50" id=
    "Page_50"></a>drinking; and we know he cannot live upon love
    alone. The weather has been exceedingly hot the last week, the
    thermometer fluctuating from 94 degrees to 100 degrees in the
    shade. The embargo has proved a famous harvest to some
    merchants here. It is certainly the most ridiculous measure
    imaginable, and was evidently adopted with the view of pleasing
    France; but no half measure can satisfy Napoleon, and this
    colony has been raised by it to a degree of importance that
    ensures its future prosperity.</p>

    <p>I have been here but a few days, having been superseded at
    Montreal by Major-General Drummond. I do not approve much of
    the change, as being separated from the 49th is a great
    annoyance to me. But soldiers must accustom themselves to
    frequent movements; and as they have no choice, it often
    happens that they are placed in situations little agreeing with
    their inclinations. My nominal appointment has been confirmed
    at home, so that I am really a brigadier. Were the 49th ordered
    hence, the rank would not be a sufficient inducement to keep me
    in this country. In such a case, I would throw it up
    willingly.</p>

    <p>Curious scenes appear to have occurred in the Baltic. I fear
    very much that Sir James (Saumarez) may be induced to return to
    his retirement in Guernsey. Indeed, the navy has little left to
    <a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>do, while the army has now a
    glorious opportunity of distinguishing itself as much as the
    sister service. Valour the British troops always possessed, but
    unless they evince discipline, their fame will be blasted for a
    century to come.</p>

    <p>QUEBEC, November 19, 1808.</p>

    <p>Yesterday Irving's letter of the 19th September reached me.
    How very thankful I feel for his attention. But I have not
    received that which he mentions Savery had written on the same
    day, giving an account of his proceedings in Spain and
    Portugal. This is a truly mortifying disappointment, as it is
    impossible to discover by the public prints the mystery by
    which the conduct of our officers has been influenced. The
    precaution which Irving took to transcribe a part of the
    letter, has proved very lucky. Notwithstanding, I look for the
    original with unusual impatience, as Savery's opinion must be
    formed upon what he saw in full practice in the best
    disciplined army that ever, I imagine, left England. His
    observations are never thrown away.</p>

    <p>I am still confined to my room, more indeed on account of
    the badness of the weather than any want of progress in my
    recovery. We have had very hard gales from the East. The
    Iphigenia frigate, with her convoy, could not have cleared the
    land, and the greatest apprehension is entertained for her
    safety. Her commander, Captain <a name="Page_52" id=
    "Page_52"></a>Lambert, is a friend of George Brock. I find him
    an exceedingly good fellow; and I have reason to think that he
    left us well satisfied with the attention he received from
    me.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href=

    <p>Sir James Craig has certain intimation of the appointment of
    Colonel Baron de Rottenburg, of the 60th, to be a brigadier in
    this country, and he is daily looked for. This most probably
    will make a change in my situation, as one must go to the upper
    province, and, as he is senior, he will doubtless have the
    choice. My object is to get home as soon as I can obtain
    permission; but unless our affairs with America be amicably
    adjusted, of which I see no probability, I scarcely can expect
    to be permitted to move. I rejoice Savery has begun to exert
    himself to get me appointed to a more active situation. I must
    see service, or I may as well, and indeed much better, quit the
    army at once, for no one advantage can I reasonably look to
    hereafter if I remain buried in this inactive, remote corner,
    without the least mention being made of me. Should Sir James
    Saumarez return from the Baltic crowned with success, he could,
    I should think, say a good word for me to some purpose.</p>

    the severity of a winter upon his shattered <a name="Page_53"

    the dull hours with my good friends of the 49th. I have
    prevailed upon Sir James to appoint Sergeant Robinson, master
    of the band, to a situation in the commissariat at Sorel, worth
    3s. 6d. a day, with subaltern's lodging money and other
    allowances. He married a Jersey lass, whose relatives may

  <p>It will be seen by the next letter and a few others which
  follow, that Sir Isaac Brock was well aware of the existence
  among the French Canadians of a spirit of disaffection, which, in
  1837, broke out into open rebellion, the suppression of which
  earned Sir John Colborne (the present Lord Seaton) his peerage.
  The outbreak caused great loss of life, and considerable expense
  arising not only from the hurried dispatch to Quebec of a large
  body of troops from Nova Scotia and England, but from the
  retention in the Canadas of about 10,000 men for a few years, to
  overawe the disaffected, and to repress the piratical incursions
  of the citizens of the United States in their favor.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, December 31, 1809.</p>

    <p>You will long since have been convinced that the American
    government is determined to involve the two countries in a war;
    they have already given us legitimate cause, but, if wise, we
    will stu<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>diously avoid doing
    that for which they shew so great an anxiety. Their finances,
    you will perceive, are very low, and they dare not propose
    direct taxes. They must have recourse to loans at a time when
    they have only six frigates in commission, and about five
    thousand men embodied. To what a state of poverty and
    wretchedness would the accumulated expenses of war reduce them!
    But they look to the success of their privateers for a supply,
    and contemplate the sweeping away of all foreign debts as the
    means of reducing the calls upon their treasury. Whatever steps
    England may adopt, I think she cannot, in prudence, avoid
    sending a strong military force to these provinces, as they are
    now become of infinite importance to her. You can scarcely
    conceive the quantity of timber and spars of all kinds which
    are lying on the beach, ready for shipment to England in the
    spring: four hundred vessels would not be sufficient to take
    all away. Whence can England be supplied with these essential
    articles but from the Canadas? Bonaparte, it is known, has
    expressed a strong desire to be in possession of the colonies
    formerly belonging to France, and now that they are become so
    valuable to England, his anxiety to wrest them from us will
    naturally increase. A small French force, 4 or 5,000 men, with
    plenty of muskets, would most assuredly conquer this province.
    The Canadians would join them almost to a man&mdash;at least,
    the exceptions would be so few as to be of little avail. It may
    appear surprising <a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>that men,
    petted as they have been and indulged in every thing they could
    desire, should wish for a change. But so it is&mdash;and I am
    apt to think that were Englishmen placed in the same situation,
    they would shew even more impatience to escape from French
    rule. How essentially different are the feelings of the people
    from when I first knew them. The idea prevails generally among
    them, that Napoleon must succeed, and ultimately get possession
    of these provinces. The bold and violent are becoming every day
    more audacious; and the timid, with that impression, think it
    better and more prudent to withdraw altogether from the society
    of the English, rather than run the chance of being accused
    hereafter of partiality to them. The consequence is, that
    little or no intercourse exists between the two races. More
    troops will be required in this country, were it only to keep
    down this growing turbulent spirit. The governor will, it is
    foreseen, have a difficult card to play next month with the
    assembly, which is really getting too daring and arrogant.
    Every victory which Napoleon has gained for the last nine
    years, has made the disposition here to resist more
    manifest.</p>

    <p>It was my decided intention to ask for leave to go to
    England this fall, but I have now relinquished <a name=
    "Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>the thought. Several untoward
    circumstances combine to oppose my wishes. The spirit of
    insubordination lately manifested by the French Canadian
    population of this colony, naturally called for precautionary
    measures, and our worthy chief is induced, in consequence, to
    retain in this country those on whom he can best confide. I am
    highly flattered in being reckoned among the number, whatever
    inward disappointment I may feel. Some unpleasant events have
    likewise happened in the upper country, which have occasioned
    my receiving intimation to proceed thither, whether as a
    permanent station, or merely as a temporary visit, Sir James
    Craig has not determined. Should, however, a senior brigadier
    to myself come out in the course of the summer, I shall
    certainly be fixed in the upper province, and there is every
    probability of such an addition very soon. Since all my efforts
    to get more actively employed have failed; since fate decrees
    that the best portion of my life is to be wasted in inaction in
    the Canadas, I am rather pleased with the prospect of removing
    upwards.</p>

    <p>There is a lady living at Barnet for whom I feel much
    interested. If you should by chance drive that way, and do not
    object to form a new acquaintance, I wish you to call upon her.
    She is the wife of Captain Manners, of the 49th, and the
    daughter of the celebrated Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia. She has a
    most amiable disposition and genteel manners. Her sister, Mrs.
    Ross Cuthbert, a charming little creature, makes her
    husband&mdash;my <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>most
    intimate friend, and with whom I pass a great part of my
    leisure hours&mdash;a most happy man.</p>

    <p>I received the other day a long and exceedingly well written
    letter from Henrietta Tupper&mdash;she is really a charming
    girl. What Maria<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=
    "FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class=

  </div>

  <p><i>Brigadier Brock to his brother Irving</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, July 9, 1810.</p>

    <p>I have a thousand thanks to offer you for the very great
    attention you have shewn in executing my commissions: the
    different articles arrived in the very best order, with the
    exception of the cocked hat, which has not been
    received&mdash;a most distressing circumstance, as, from the
    enormity of my head<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id=
    "FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class=
    "fnanchor">[26]</a>, I find the utmost difficulty in getting a
    substitute in this country.</p>

    <p>I proposed writing to you early to-morrow, but Sir James
    having this instant intimated his intention of sending me
    upwards immediately, I avail myself of an hour's leisure to do
    that hastily which I would gladly have done quietly, and,
    consequently, more fully. If I am to remain in this country, I
    care little where I am placed; but going up, as I do now,
    without knowing whether I am to stay or return, is particularly
    awkward, and interferes materially in all my future
    arrange<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>ments: perhaps I
    shall be able to get the point settled before I commence my
    journey.</p>

    <p>Every thing here remains in a state of perfect quietness. It
    is but too evident that the Canadians generally are becoming
    daily more anxious to get rid of the English. This they cannot
    effect unless a French force come to their aid, and I do not
    think that Bonaparte would risk the loss of a fleet and army
    for the chance of getting possession of the country. What
    infatuation! No people had ever more cause to rejoice at their
    fate; but they are not singular, as all mankind seems prone to
    change, however disadvantageous or productive of confusion.</p>

    <p>Savery forwarded your pamphlet to me. You have taken a very
    proper view of the political dissensions which at this moment
    disgrace England. Those to whom I have allowed a perusal, and
    who are infinitely better judges than I can pretend to be,
    speak of the purity of the language in terms of high
    approbation. You have happily suited the style to the matter.
    Several copies have, within a few days, been in circulation
    here. Savery speaks of a letter you received, in consequence,
    from Lord Melville. I hope you will not fail in sending me a
    copy, as I am all anxiety for your literary fame. As you differ
    in sentiment from the Edinburgh Review, I hope that you have
    made up your mind to an unmerciful lashing.</p>

    <p>I do not see the smallest prospect of my getting away from
    here, as the disposition manifested by <a name="Page_59" id=
    "Page_59"></a>the Canadians will occasion a large military
    force to be kept in the country, and it will serve as a plea to
    retain all at their posts. I wish that I could boast of a
    little more patience than I feel I now possess.</p>

    <p>The fortifications of Quebec are improving pretty rapidly,
    but workmen cannot be procured in sufficient number to proceed
    as fast as government would wish. Labourers now get 7s. 6d. a
    day, and artificers from 12s. to 15s. Upwards of three hundred
    vessels have already arrived&mdash;a prodigious number.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, July 10, 1810.</p>

    <p>I cannot allow the frigate to depart without sending my
    affectionate love to you. A Guernsey vessel arrived a few days
    ago, which brought me a letter from Savery of 10th May, and
    nothing could be more gratifying than the contents. The May
    fleet, which sailed from Portsmouth the 24th, reached this in
    thirty days, but as it had not a scrape of a pen for me, its
    arrival did not interest me. We have been uncommonly gay the
    last fortnight: two frigates at anchor, and the arrival of
    Governor Gore from the upper province, have given a zest to
    society. Races, country and water parties, have occupied our
    time in a continued round of festivity. Such stimulus is highly
    necessary to keep our spirits afloat. I contributed my share to
    the general mirth in a grand dinner given <a name="Page_60" id=
    "Page_60"></a>to Mrs. Gore, at which Sir J. Craig was present,
    and a ball to a vast assemblage of all descriptions.</p>

    <p>I mentioned in a former letter my apprehensions of being
    ordered to the upper province. I return this moment from
    waiting upon Sir James, who sent for me, to say he regretted he
    must part with me, as he found it absolutely necessary that I
    should proceed upwards without delay. I am placed in a very
    awkward predicament, as my stay in that country depends wholly
    upon contingencies. Should a brigadier arrive I am to be
    stationary, but otherwise return to Quebec. Nothing could be
    more provoking and inconvenient than this arrangement. Unless I
    take up every thing with me, I shall be miserably off, for
    nothing beyond eatables is to be had there; and in case I
    provide the requisites to make my abode in the winter in any
    way comfortable, and then be ordered back, the expense will be
    ruinous. But I must submit to all this without repining, and
    since I cannot get to Europe, I care little where I am placed.
    I have the most delightful garden imaginable, with abundance of
    melons and other good things, all which I must now desert.</p>

    <p>What am I to tell you from this out-of-the-way place. Your
    old friends of the 49th are well, but scattered in small
    detachments all over the country. They are justly great
    favorites at head quarters. I mentioned in a former letter my
    wish that, provided you could make it perfectly convenient, you
    would call upon Mrs. Manners, the wife of a <a name="Page_61"
    id="Page_61"></a>captain of the 49th. I am satisfied that you
    would, after a short acquaintance, approve of her
    much&mdash;she is all goodness. By the last accounts they
    resided at Barnet.</p>

    <p>I have no doubt that Maria and Zelia (Potenger, his nieces)
    continue to conduct themselves in such a manner as to reward
    you amply for the unbounded kindness you have all along shewn
    them. If I am able in the fall to procure handsome skins for
    muffs worth their acceptance, I shall send some to the dear
    little girls: they ought, however, to write to me. There are
    few here brought up with the advantages they have received;
    indeed, the means for education are very limited for both sexes
    in this colony. Heaven preserve you. I shall probably begin my
    journey upwards in the course of a few days.</p>

    and her manners uncommonly pleasing, graceful, and affable.
    There is, I fancy, a very great disparity of years. They both
    speak English very fluently, and with very little foreign
    accent. Sir James (Craig) is remarkably well: we celebrated the
    anniversary of his sixtieth year yesterday at a very pleasant
    party at Powell Place. Our general court martial is over, and
    will be published in orders to-morrow. A soldier, who was under
    sentence of death for desertion from the 101st regiment, and
    transferred to the 8th, and a Jonathan of the Canadians, who is

    <p>My good and dear friends,&mdash;I have been of late so much
    upon the move, that I had no thought of writing to you, and no
    letters of yours put me in mind that I should do so. Here I am

    lucky as to obtain leave, I shall not commence my journey to
    New York until after Christmas. Baron de Rottenburg, a senior

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, October 4, 1810.</p>

    <p>By yesterday's post, I was favored with your letter of the
    23d ultimo. I regret that so much trouble should have been
    occasioned to so little purpose, the more so as I apprehend an
    example to be much called for in the 100th regiment. Murray
    seems sanguine that the regiment will go <a name="Page_64" id=
    "Page_64"></a>on better under his rule, and that he knows the
    men better. I hope his conjecture may prove well founded, but I
    fear they are too wild a set to thrive in Upper Canada.</p>

    <p>As I felt at a loss how to introduce the subject of your
    personal views and wishes, I gave Sir James your letter to
    read; it did not, however, draw from him any remark on those
    topics. I know that he is very strongly impressed with the
    necessity of having a person like yourself for some time in the
    Upper Province, that a scrutinizing eye may correct the errors
    and neglect that have crept in, and put all in order again;
    and, <i>in confidence between ourselves</i>, I do not think he
    would be more ready to part with you from that station, in
    consequence of the arrival of Colonel Murray, who is not at all
    to his taste, and has managed, by a most indiscreet and
    indecent conversation at his table, to blot himself out of his
    good opinion. The conversation was on the subject of Cobbett,
    and the colonel's the only dissenting voice, which he exerted
    with the more energy in proportion to the badness of his cause,
    and after defending him in a style and language highly
    indecorous, and reprehensible to be held at the table of the
    governor, he so completely forgot himself as to repeat and
    justify the very offensive and illiberal publications of
    Cobbett respecting the German troops and foreign officers,
    although sitting directly opposite to General de Rottenburg.
    Sir James, who was suffering extremely from the commencement

    illness, could contain himself no longer, and silenced Murray

    any officer, entrusted with the honor of commanding a corps,

    <p>Your successor, as commandant of Quebec, is certainly much

    beautiful,&mdash;lively, discreet, witty, affable,&mdash;in
    short, so engaging, or rather so fascinating, that neither the
    courier nor my paper will admit of my doing her justice;
    however, from what I have said it is necessary further to add
    and explain, that this is not my opinion alone but that of the
    public.</p>

    <p>Sir James has conversed with me fully on the subject of your
    wish for leave, and prefaced it by declaring himself very
    desirous on his part to for<a name="Page_67" id=
    "Page_67"></a>ward your views as far as he could do so with
    propriety, but that he had written in such strong terms, urging
    the necessity of a third general officer being kept constantly
    on the staff of the Canadas, and assigned as a principal reason
    the advantage of an officer of that rank being stationed in the
    Upper Province, that he does not conceive himself at liberty to
    overset an arrangement which he has been two years soliciting
    the means to carry into effect, and the absolute necessity of
    which he is highly impressed with. In reply to an observation
    of mine, that you regretted the inactive prospect before you,
    and looked with envy on those employed in Spain and Portugal,
    he said: "I make no doubt of it, but I can in no shape aid his
    plans in that respect; I would not, however, be the means of
    preventing them, and although from his local knowledge I should
    regret losing him in this country, yet I would not oppose it if
    he could obtain an appointment to the staff on service; but in
    that case I would ask for another general officer being seat in
    his place immediately to Upper Canada." I tell you this, my
    dear general, without reserve, and give you, as far as I can
    recollect, Sir James' words. If he liked you less, he might
    perhaps be more readily induced to let you go; as matters
    stand, I do not think he will, although I am convinced that he
    will feel very sincere regret in refusing you on a subject upon
    which you appear to be so anxious.</p>

    <p>FORT GEORGE, Jan. 6, 1811.</p>

    <p>Having lately received a letter from Colonel Vesey, in which
    he urges me to ascertain whether it be possible to secure to
    his family some benefit from the grant of five thousand acres
    he has so long unprofitably held, I am encouraged by the
    disposition your excellency has uniformly evinced to serve him,
    to renew my earnest request that your influence may be now
    exerted in his behalf.</p>

    <p>I am given to understand that there are extensive tracts of
    excellent land at the disposal of the crown on Lake Erie, and
    that a new township is undergoing a survey near the head of
    Lake Ontario. Were it possible to ensure Colonel Vesey eligible
    situations in those districts, he no longer would hesitate in
    incurring the necessary expense.</p>

    <p>Your excellency having signified your intention of visiting
    England in the course of next summer, I am impelled to the
    present application by the consideration that before your
    return the land, which I have taken the liberty to point out,
    may be disposed of, and Colonel Vesey thereby lose the fair
    opportunity of acquiring property upon which he can confidently
    place some value.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, January 21, 1811.</p>

    <p>Your letter of the 6th instant should have been earlier
    acknowledged, but that I was desirous to render my answer as
    satisfactory as possible, and it was necessary to refer to the
    offices, on the subject of the grant of land ordered for
    Colonel Vesey.</p>

    <p>I am very sorry now to be constrained to tell you, that it
    is not in my power to comply with Colonel Vesey's wish in
    respect of the location, without a special order from the king,
    as in the case of Colonel Talbot.</p>

    <p>The diagram by which the crown and clergy reserves are
    recorded, cannot be dispensed with, so that it is now
    impracticable to obtain in any township five thousand acres in
    a block.</p>

    <p>The townships lately surveyed are partial exceptions to the
    general rule, for the express purpose of establishing roads
    through the province, and the locations in that exception are
    by an act of government expressly reserved for actual
    settlers.</p>

    <p>The utmost in my power to do for Colonel Vesey is to adopt
    the latitude directed by his majesty in favor of General
    Arnold, which is to permit his representative to locate his
    land in any open township, and to pass the patent without his
    personal attendance.</p>

    <p>Exclusive of my very strong desire to serve Colonel Vesey, I
    beg you will believe that I should <a name="Page_70" id=
    "Page_70"></a>have had a very particular gratification in
    promoting the success of any measure for which you are pleased
    to express an interest.</p>

  <p><i>Brigadier Brock to his brother Irving.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>NIAGARA, January 10, 1811.</p>

    <p>I cannot sufficiently thank you for your constant attention
    to me; you contribute largely to render my present sequestered
    abode tolerable, and let me entreat you to continue the
    practice you have lately adopted of sending me a letter every
    fortnight. In addition to the last daily paper, send me
    likewise the <i>Observer</i>, or any other weekly depository of
    domestic news. You, who have passed all your days in the bustle
    of London, can scarcely conceive the uninteresting and insipid
    life I am doomed to lead in this retirement. My situation
    obliges me to maintain some sort of establishment, otherwise I
    should, from inclination, confine my intercourse to a very
    limited circle. I have been for some days projecting a jaunt
    into the interior of the States, and I may probably visit New
    York before I return, but I shall weigh passing events well,
    ere I hazard so long a journey. The heavy rains which have
    fallen for the last ten days have delayed my progress, as I did
    not choose to undertake the journey on horseback. I by no means
    admire travelling alone in so comfortless a manner, in which
    the gratification would not repay the inconvenience.</p>

    <p>I purpose directing my steps in the first instance <a name=
    "Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>to Ballstown, a medicinal water of
    great celebrity, about twenty miles north of Albany. I then
    expect to be joined by James Brock, and probably by some others
    of the 49th. I shall wait ten days, not only to give him full
    time to come up, but likewise to try the efficacy of the
    waters, as I have an idea that they will be serviceable to me.
    I feel at this moment infinitely better, but am not quite the
    thing, without knowing what ails me. A sound jolting and change
    of air will produce wonders, and make me look once more upon a
    beefsteak with appetite. At present I live very abstemiously,
    and scarcely ever touch wine.</p>

    <p>I mentioned in a former letter that the new arrangements
    deprived me of the comfort of a companion. Expecting to obtain
    leave to visit England, I thought it of little consequence, but
    now that such an indulgence is denied me, I feel sadly the want
    of a lively, communicative associate. I hardly ever stir out,
    and, unless I have company at home, my evenings are passed
    solus. I read much, but good books are scarce, and I hate
    borrowing. I like to read a book quickly, and afterwards revert
    to such passages as have made the deepest impression, and which
    appear to me most important to remember&mdash;a practice I
    cannot conveniently pursue unless the book be mine. Should you
    find that I am likely to remain here, I wish you to send me
    some choice authors in history, particularly ancient, with
    maps, and the best translations of ancient works. I read in
    <a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>my youth Pope's Translation
    of Homer, but till lately never discovered its exquisite
    beauties. As I grow old, I acquire a taste for study. I firmly
    believe that the same propensity was always inherent in me,
    but, strange to tell, although many were paid extravagantly, I
    never had the advantage of a master to guide and encourage me.
    But it is now too late to repine. I rejoice that my nephews are
    more fortunate.</p>

    <p>The president's address is sufficiently hostile, and if I
    thought that he would be supported to the extent of his wishes,
    I should consider war to be inevitable. Congress will hesitate
    before consenting to go the length he proposes. The taking
    forcible possession of West Florida may provoke a war sooner
    than any other act, but it is impossible to foresee how such a
    step may be viewed by the Cortes. We are at this moment in
    awful suspense&mdash;the king's illness, the proximity of the
    armies under Massena and Wellington, and the measures our
    government may deem proper to adopt to meet the hostile
    proceedings of the Americans, afford serious matter for
    contemplation.</p>

    <p>I have seen "Thoughts on Political Fanaticism," in answer to
    your admirable pamphlet. The author appears to me to proclaim
    his servile attachment to Bonaparte, without in any degree
    refuting your arguments. When you tell me that Peter Tupper is
    a son of the jurat, and a member of the Junta of Valencia, you
    by no means satisfy my curiosity. Is he equal to fill the
    situation? <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>Has he
    discretion, and is he distinguished by a strong mind and
    undaunted courage, as these are qualities that can alone be
    serviceable at such a crisis? I observed his name some little
    time back in the public prints, without knowing who he could
    be, and I suppose that he is my junior in age by several
    years.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href=

    <p>Baynes tells me that he has written to you repeatedly, and
    most fully and confidentially, on the subject of your
    application for leave. The letters, which I have received from
    home, explicitly state that the last brevet was made so
    extensive with the view of doing away with the appointment of
    brigadier, so that no general officer under the rank of
    major-general will be in future employed; independent of this
    circumstance, you have no reason, believe me, to dread being
    unemployed in any rank while you have a wish to
    serve,&mdash;this opinion, my dear general, is not given rashly
    or upon slight grounds,&mdash;before I came to this country I
    had, you must know, several opportunities <a name="Page_74" id=
    "Page_74"></a>of hearing your name mentioned at head quarters,
    both by General Calvert and Colonel Gordon, who unquestionably
    spoke the sentiments of the then commander-in-chief, and in
    such a way as to impress me with a thorough conviction that few
    officers of your rank stood higher in their estimation. In
    short, I have no manner of doubt whatever that you will readily
    obtain employment upon active service the moment that <i>you do
    get home</i>, and with this view I recommend you to express,
    through Baynes, your sense of his excellency's good intentions
    and wishes towards you in respect to leave of absence, and your
    hopes that when the circumstances of the country are such as
    will permit him to grant six months' leave to a general
    officer, that this indulgence will be extended in the first
    instance to you. I am very happy to find that you are pleased
    with Mrs. Murray: I have just received a long letter from her,
    giving me an account of a splendid ball given by you to the
    <i>beau monde</i> of Niagara and its vicinity, and the manner
    in which she speaks of your liberality and hospitality reminds
    me of the many pleasant hours I have passed under your roof.
    <i>We have no such parties now</i>, and the indisposition of
    Sir James having prevented the usual public days at the castle,
    nothing more stupid than Quebec now is can be imagined.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><i>Colonel Baylies to
  Brigadier Brock, at Fort George</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, February 14, 1811.</p>

    <p>From the sincere and lively interest which I am sure you
    feel for our worthy chief, I am happy to announce to you that
    an important change has taken place in his disease, from which
    his medical attendants augur, with great confidence, most
    essential and permanent relief. On Sunday last I received a
    summons to attend immediately at the castle, where Kempt was
    also called, and to our extreme astonishment he informed us
    that he was then about to undergo the operation of tapping, as
    he fully coincided with his medical attendants who advised it.
    Sir James (Craig) proceeded with great calmness to give me some
    instructions as his executor, in the event of any fatal
    consequence following, which he did with a degree of composure,
    and even cheerfulness, which only a mind like his can assume.
    We were present, at his request, at the operation, which
    appeared to me painfully tedious&mdash;but not an expression,
    or even a look of impatience, escaped Sir James, whose manner
    absolutely inspired spirits and fortitude to those around. At
    the close he stood up for several minutes to let the water
    drain from the higher parts of the body, and thirty-six pints,
    weighing nearly as many pounds, were altogether drawn off.</p>

    <p>Sir James lately received accounts of the 14th of November,
    that his brother, General Peter <a name="Page_76" id=
    "Page_76"></a>Craig, was then so reduced and weak from a long
    and severe illness, that no hopes were entertained of him. You
    will conceive what a severe shock this has been, the more so as
    Sir James never harboured a doubt that his elder brother, from
    his apparently stronger constitution, would have long survived
    him. Their mutual ties of relationship were in a manner
    concentrated in each other, for Sir James will have none left
    but of a very distant degree.</p>

    <p>I am happy to find by a long letter from Mrs. Murray to
    Colonel Kempt, that you have found the means of enlivening the
    solitary scene that has so long prevailed at Fort George. I
    assure you that we miss you much here, and that the fascinating
    Mrs. de Rottenburg, with all her charms, has not effaced the
    very universal regret which your loss occasions in Quebec.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Brigadier Brock to his brother Irving</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>NIAGARA, February 19, 1811.</p>

    <p>Nothing can be more considerate, nothing more friendly, than
    your constancy in writing to me. Your last letter is dated the
    26th November. What can I say from this remote corner in return
    for the pleasure I experience at the receipt of your letters? I
    have already described my sombre kind of life, but I am sure
    you will rejoice to hear that my present quiet has been
    productive of the essential good of restoring my health. I now
    consider myself quite re-established; therefore, my good
    <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>Irving, dispel all your
    alarms on my account. I once thought of visiting Ballstown,
    but, as a trial of the springs there was my chief motive, I
    gave up the journey the moment I found there was no medical
    occasion to undertake it. I do not admire the manners of the
    American people. I have met with some whose society was every
    thing one could desire, and at Boston and New York such
    characters are, I believe, numerous, but these are the
    exceptions. Politics run very high at this moment, but the
    French faction have evidently the preponderance, and they style
    themselves republicans! Was ever any thing more absurd? A
    dreadful crash is not far off&mdash;I hope your friends have
    withheld their confidence in their public stocks. There have
    been many failures at New York, and the merchants there are in
    a state of great confusion and dismay.</p>

    <p>I returned recently from York, the capital of this province,
    where I passed ten days with the governor, (Gore,) as generous
    and as honest a being as ever existed. His lady is perfectly
    well bred and very agreeable. I found ample recompense in their
    society for the inconvenience of travelling over the worst
    roads I ever met with. The governor was formerly quartered with
    the 44th in Guernsey, and recollects vividly the society of
    those days.</p>

    <p>I seldom hear from James Brock, who dislikes writing to such
    a degree, that he hazards the loss of a friend rather than
    submit to the trouble; and <a name="Page_78" id=
    "Page_78"></a>what is strange, when he sets about it he
    expresses himself happily, and is highly entertaining.</p>

    <p>Sir James Craig has triumphed completely over the French
    faction in the Lower Province. By their conduct they have fully
    exemplified the character of their ancestors. The moment they
    found they could not intimidate by threats, they became as
    obsequious as they had been violent. The house of assembly
    passed every bill required of them, among others one
    authorizing the governor-general and three councillors to
    imprison any one without assigning a cause. The state of the
    country makes such a measure highly necessary. Sir James has
    been very ill, and it is supposed that he cannot long survive
    the fierce and frequent attacks of his disorder. His death,
    whenever it comes, will be bewailed by all who possess the
    feelings of Englishmen in this country. He appears determined
    to keep me near his person, and I hardly know how to accomplish
    my grand object of visiting England in opposition to his
    wishes. You may well imagine the regret I feel in being obliged
    to submit to a life of such complete idleness&mdash;but fate

    will not conspire to diminish or circumscribe his regal powers.

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>NIAGARA, February 27, 1811.</p>

    <p>I have this day been honored by the receipt of your
    excellency's letter, dated the 4th instant. The subject to
    which it refers has occasioned serious reflection in my mind.
    If unfortunately the Indians be determined to commit acts of
    hostility in the spring, they are at too great a distance for
    us to succeed in any effort we may be disposed to make to avert
    so great a calamity. Therefore, the next consideration is the
    posture we are to assume in case of such an event; whether we
    are to re<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>main in a state of
    strict neutrality, which doubtless the Americans will call upon
    us to observe, and thereby sacrifice our influence over the
    Indians; or, unmindful of the consequences, continue to them
    the accustomed supplies of food, arms, and ammunition.</p>

    <p>I lament to think that the Indians retired from the council,
    in which they declared their resolution of going to war, with a
    full conviction that, although they could not look for active
    co-operation on our part, yet they might rely with confidence
    upon receiving from us every requisite of war.</p>

    <p>Our cold attempt to dissuade that much-injured people from
    engaging in such a rash enterprise could scarcely be expected
    to prevail, particularly after giving such manifest indications
    of a contrary sentiment by the liberal quantity of military
    stores with which they were dismissed.</p>

    <p>I shall not fail in reporting every circumstance that may
    come to my knowledge relative to our connections with the
    Indians, which I think your excellency may desire to be
    acquainted with: I must look to officers commanding at the
    outposts for such information, as the lieut.-governor withholds
    from me all communications on the subject.</p>

    <p>Mr. Elliott, who has the management of the Indian department
    at Amherstburg, is an exceedingly good man, and highly
    respected by the Indians; but, having in his youth lived a
    great deal with them, he naturally has imbibed their <a name=
    "Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>feelings and prejudices, and
    partaking in the wrongs they continually suffer, this sympathy
    made him neglect the considerations of prudence, which ought to
    have regulated his conduct. If he had delayed the issue of
    presents until he reported their mission to Lieut.-Governor
    Gore, they would have returned to their companions, carrying
    with them the positive sentiments of government.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Brigadier Brock to Major Taylor, 100th Regiment, commanding
  at Amherstburg</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>NIAGARA, March 4, 1811.</p>

    <p>You omitted to report to me the important resolution which
    the Indians formally announced last autumn in council to have
    been adopted by the different nations, of going to war with the
    Americans. Having however received advice of the circumstance
    through other channels, I was enabled to communicate the
    interesting fact to head quarters, and now transcribe, for
    <i>your individual</i> information and future guidance,
    extracts of his excellency's <i>secret</i> and
    <i>confidential</i> answer, dated 4th ultimo:</p>

    <p>"Although the conduct of our intercourse with the Indians is
    by his majesty's command vested in the civil government of the
    province of Canada, and consequently the interference of
    military officers, otherwise than by being present at such
    councils as may be held as they are directed to be, would be
    improper, I nevertheless desire that you will instruct the
    officers in command at the different posts, particularly at
    Amherstburg, to report <a name="Page_82" id=
    "Page_82"></a>confidentially to you what may pass at those
    councils, as well as any other transactions in which the
    Indians are concerned, and which may come to their knowledge;
    these reports you will forward to me occasionally, as you may
    think them of importance."</p>

    <p>The conduct which the military are expected to pursue in
    their intercourse with the Indian department is so explicitly
    stated in the above, that I need not say a word more on the
    subject. But I think it highly necessary to put you in
    possession of the policy which Sir James Craig is very anxious
    may be observed in the present uncertain state of our political
    affairs.</p>

    <p>"I am decidedly of opinion, that upon every principle of
    policy our interest should lead us to use all our endeavours to
    prevent a rupture between the Indians and the subjects of the
    United States. Upon these considerations, I think it would be
    expedient to instruct the officers of the Indian department to
    use all their influence to dissuade the Indians from their
    projected plan of hostility, giving them clearly to understand
    that they must not expect any assistance from us. The officers,
    however, should be extremely cautious in pointing out to them
    that it is for their own good only that this advice is given to
    them, and not from any dereliction of that regard with which we
    always view their interests; it will perhaps require some
    management to avoid exciting their jealousy or resentment; the
    doing so must be strongly recommended."</p>

    <p>I wish you to comprehend clearly the sentiments of Sir James
    upon this essential point; because, although I entertain great
    respect for the personal character of Mr. Elliott, yet I should
    be unwilling <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>to place entire
    dependance in an affair of such manifest importance, upon a
    judgment biased and prejudiced as his is known to be in every
    thing that regards the Indians. To act with due prudence, he
    participates in and feels too keenly the grievous wrongs they
    have suffered. Should you, therefore, perceive the smallest
    indication to depart from the line so strongly marked by his
    excellency for the government of the Indian officers, you will,
    without creating suspicion of an intention of controlling their
    measures, offer friendly advice, and even have recourse to
    written protests to deter them from persevering in any act that
    may have a tendency to irritate and expose the two nations to
    endless controversy. All this you of course will do as coming
    from yourself, and you will be very regular in reporting
    circumstantially every occurrence that may come to your
    knowledge, to enable me to conform strictly with the
    instructions of the commander-in-chief.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, March 4, 1811.</p>

    <p>Sir James desires me to tell you that he had fully intended
    writing to you himself by this day's post, but, from the
    arrival of the January mail and the departure of the Halifax
    courier to-mor<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>row, he finds
    himself so much occupied that he has deputed me to explain to
    you the cause of his not announcing to you by his own pen the
    resolution he finds himself under the necessity of adopting, of
    returning to England early in the summer. I think it probable
    that he will leave this by the July fleet; indeed, the
    extremely weak and debilitated state of his health will not
    admit of his deferring his departure longer, lest it might
    involve him in inconveniences attendant upon an equinoctial or
    fall passage. It is with the deepest regret I observe that his
    strength is visibly sinking under his disease, although the
    latter does not appear to have increased in violence; on the
    contrary, for this fortnight past he seems in better spirits
    and to suffer less pain: the first probably arises from the
    prospect of his being speedily relieved from the weight and
    anxiety of his public charge, for, with regard to himself, his
    mind is most perfectly made up, and resigned to a very speedy
    termination of all his sufferings; and his anxiety has been
    latterly much excited from the apprehension of his becoming too
    ill to be able to undertake the voyage, and being obliged to
    linger out the short remnant of his life in this country.</p>

    <p>I assure you he is very far from being indifferent in regard
    to forwarding your wishes; but from the necessity of his
    retiring himself, and even without waiting for leave to do so,
    he feels it the more indispensably necessary to leave this
    country in the best state of security he can, and that, under
    <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>existing circumstances, he
    cannot attend to your request for leave. He desires me to say,
    that he regrets extremely the disappointment you may
    experience, and he requests that you will do him the favor to
    accept, as a legacy and mark of his very sincere regard, his
    favorite horse Alfred, and that he is induced to send him to
    you, not only from wishing to secure to his old favorite a kind
    and careful master, but from the conviction that the whole
    continent of America could not furnish you with so safe and
    excellent a horse. Alfred is ten years old, but being a high
    bred horse, and latterly but very little worked, he may be
    considered as still perfectly fresh. Sir James will give him up
    to Heriot, whenever you fix the mode of his being forwarded to
    you.</p>

    <p>I have requested Sir James to allow me to accompany him
    home, a duty I should feel a most grateful pleasure in
    performing; but with a kind regard to what he thinks more to my
    interest, he will not accede to my wishes, but insists on my
    remaining here, as he thinks that my appointment will be
    considered permanent. Kempt goes home, his private affairs
    requiring his presence, and having strong ground to hope that
    he will be able to resign his staff for an active brigade;
    although his senior in years and length of service, I must
    still wait a long time before I can direct my ambition to so
    desirable an object.</p>

    <p>You will have seen by Sir James' speech, the very complete
    triumph his firmness and energy <a name="Page_86" id=
    "Page_86"></a>have obtained over the factious cabal of their
    most contemptible assembly. Bedard will be shortly
    released&mdash;that fellow alone of the whole gang has nerve,
    and does not want ability or inclination to do mischief
    whenever opportunity offers; the rest, old Papineau and the
    blustering B&mdash;&mdash;, are all white-livered runagates to
    a man; but when Sir James' back is turned, they will rally and
    commence the same bullying attack on his successor, who, I
    trust, will follow his example.</p>

    <p>I am bound to Sicily in about a fortnight, as a

    William Bentinck, who is destined to command the forces in that

    command of the Sicilian army likewise.</p>

    <p>I thank you much for the interesting details of local
    politics, both military and civil, which your letter contains,
    for I feel a more than common wish to know what passes in
    Canada, although I am certainly not partial to that
    country&mdash;quite the reverse. It is a pity that the 49th
    should be detained there so long, as it will interfere
    materially with the promotion of your officers. I fear you will
    have passed a lonely winter at Fort George, notwithstanding the
    addition of my friend Murray and his nice little wife to your
    society. Pray remember me kindly to them and to my old <a name=
    "Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>friend, St. George. Mrs. Vesey has
    charged me to call her to your recollection in the kindest
    manner; she and my six children are as well as possible, and a
    very nice little group they are, all as healthy as can be. I
    wish I had a daughter old enough for you, as I would give her
    to you with pleasure. You should be married, particularly as
    fate seems to detain you so long in Canada&mdash;but pray do
    not marry there.</p>

    <p>HAMPTON COURT PARK, May 9, 1811.</p>

    <p>I received a few days ago your letter of the 22d February,
    for which I thank you very much. I am very much obliged to you
    for taking so much trouble about my grant of land, respecting
    which I have not taken any steps whatever here, neither shall I
    so long as Lord Liverpool continues to direct the affairs of
    the colonial department, for he is not friendly to me, but I
    will reserve my claims for a more favorable moment. I am not
    the less thankful for your friendship on the occasion.</p>

    <p>I quite feel for you, my good friend, when I think of the
    stupid and uninteresting time you must have passed in Upper
    Canada&mdash;with your ardour for professional employment in
    the field, it must have been very painful. I did not think Sir
    James (Craig) would have detained you so long against your
    will. Had you returned to Europe, there is little doubt but
    that you would immediately have been employed in Portugal, and,
    <a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>as that service has turned
    out so very creditable, I regret very much that you had not
    deserted from Canada. I take it for granted that you will not
    stay there long, and should the fortune of war bring us again
    upon duty in the same country, I need not say how I shall hail
    the event with joy. If you come to England, I would wish you to
    call upon the Duke of Kent,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id=
    "FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class=
    "fnanchor">[34]</a> who has a high respect for you, and will be
    happy to see you.</p>

    <p>It seems determined that the Duke of York shall return to
    the command of the army; it would have taken place ere now, but
    for some ill-natured remarks inserted in some of the
    newspapers, produced by an over zeal on the part of his
    friends. Sir David (Dundas) will not be much regretted, and it
    surely is time that at his advanced period of life he should be
    relieved from the cares of office.</p>

    <p>I am rejoiced to find that you live so comfortably with my
    friend Murray and his nice little wife. Mrs. Vesey and myself
    took a great fancy to her the morning she called here, on their
    way to Portsmouth.</p>

  <p>On the 4th June, 1811, Brigadier Brock was promoted, and
  appointed by the prince regent to serve from that day as a
  major-general on the staff of North America. On the 19th of the
  same month, Sir James Craig embarked on board his majesty's ship
  Amelia for England, leaving Mr. Dunn in charge of the government
  of the Lower Province, and Lieut.-General Drummond in command of
  the forces in the Canadas, consisting of 445 artillery, 3,783
  regular troops, and 1,226 Fencibles; in all, 5,454 men. He seemed
  disgusted with the cares of a government, in which he had
  experienced only crosses and mortification, as his administration
  was decidedly unpopular among the great mass of the French
  Canadians. His health had long been wasting away with a dropsy
  and other infirmities, and he doubted whether he should live to
  reach England, where he however survived several months, and met
  with a most gracious reception from his immediate superiors. Sir
  James Craig had been from his youth in the service of his
  country,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and he owed to
  <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>merit alone his rank and
  consideration in the army. He was corpulent in person, and rather
  below the middle stature; his features were strong and regular,
  his aspect was severe and imposing, his deportment, manly and
  dignified; in society he was polite, frank, and affable. He is
  said to have been positive in his opinions, and therefore prompt
  and decisive in his measures. To a clear and comprehensive
  judgment, he united the best qualities of the heart, and though
  hasty in temper, he was easily reconciled to those who might
  involuntarily have incurred his resentment. In fine, he seems to
  have possessed all the sterling and undisguised virtues that
  distinguish the soldier, and some of the qualities that
  constitute the able statesman. Although many differed widely in
  opinion with respect to his government, yet few could deny him
  the merit of disinterestedness and integrity in the discharge of
  his public duties. He may have erred in the performance of the
  important and complicated functions of his post, but he was
  guided by sincerity; and it is due to his memory to add, that the
  objects of his administration, however erroneous the means he
  pursued for their attainment, were the concord, the happiness,
  and the prosperity of the people whom he governed for nearly four
  years.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href=

    <p>I congratulate you on your promotion, and you may return me
    the compliment. I did not expect to appear in the same brevet
    with you as a major-general; it has so happened, however, and I
    am not at all sorry to go out to Sicily as major-general
    instead of a brigadier. You have such a lot of generals in
    Canada at present, that it is impossible to continue them all
    upon the staff. Your wish will be to come home, I dare say, and
    very glad I should be if you were in England at present, while
    all the arrangements are making. It may perhaps be your fate to
    go to the Mediterranean, but the Peninsula is the most direct
    road to the honor of the Bath, and as you are an ambitious man,
    that is the station you would prefer&mdash;so should I, but I
    have been advised not to solicit for it, but to go where I was
    ordered; therefore, am I proceeding. I need not say how

    <p>The return of the duke of York to the head of the army gives

    master-general in Nova Scotia, to the astonishment of every
    body, because I suppose they do not like to take it from me
    <i>par force</i>, without giving me something in lieu of it. I
    have <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>told the treasury that
    I would not give it up upon any other terms than for my
    lieutenant-colonelcy, but that they had the power of taking it
    from me if they chose to do me that injustice: I suppose they
    will as soon as my back is turned. Lord William Bentinck is
    expected down to-day; he goes to Sicily in the Caledonia, with
    Sir Edward Pellew. As it is possible you may have left Canada,
    I shall enclose this letter to our friend Bruyeres; bid him
    read it and forward it if you are yet in that country.</p>

    <p>We were very much surprised on Thursday last by the arrival
    of the Racoon, sloop of war, from Jamaica, with the duke of
    Manchester on board, who is come with the view of visiting the
    lions of Canada previous to his return to England; he is gone,
    attended by General Drummond, to see the falls of Montmorenci,
    and the general desires me to let you know that his grace
    intends leaving this in the stage on Tuesday morning for
    Montreal. The duke has no attendant except a Colonel Gold,
    <i>ci-devant militaire</i>; he appears to be very affable, and
    perfectly <i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i>; he particularly requested
    that no compliments or ceremony of any kind might be shown him,
    and that he might be permitted to indulge his fancy by going
    about as he pleased. His grace is not likely to have many
    volunteer aides-de-camp, for he treated those who <a name=
    "Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>formed his suite yesterday to a walk
    of half a dozen hours in the sun at mid-day round the works,
    the towers, plains, &amp;c.; and from which he did not appear
    to experience the slightest inconvenience, being in the habit,
    we are told, of taking similar rambles even in the West Indies.
    The duke will pay you but a very short visit, being limited for
    time, and anxious to make his tour as extensive as possible. He
    seems to like a glass of Madeira, and would match any of the
    Canadian tribe in smoking cigars; he walks about with one in
    his mouth at all hours in the day. He begs you will have the
    kindness to secure for him a boat and a good Canadian crew to
    proceed to Kingston, and to facilitate his progress from that
    place, inasmuch as it may be in your power to do so. I
    apprehend that the movement of the troops may very materially
    interfere with him, but the duke will not object to embarking
    with any of the detachments if no other vessel can be
    spared.</p>

    to remain at Montreal to receive the duke of Manchester, as I
    think you would have felt gratified; and if you could have
    reconciled to your own feelings the want of due preparation for
    the reception of so great a person<a name="Page_94" id=
    "Page_94"></a>age, I am sure, from the specimen we had of his
    grace here, that he would have been perfectly satisfied, and
    happy to have shared your fare. He does not appear to be a
    lady's man&mdash;perhaps a little too much the contrary, and I
    am confident that a dinner with a few gentlemen, and an
    invitation to smoke, would suit his taste in preference to a
    formal f&ecirc;te. On an excursion to the Chaudi&egrave;re, of
    which Mrs. Drummond and other ladies formed part, his grace
    appeared to be very little at his ease until he effected his
    escape out of the frigate's barge into one of the small boats
    that was in attendance with his <i>compagnon de voyage</i> and
    the commander of the sloop, when, with the aid of his favorite
    cigar, he appeared to be perfectly happy. I mention these
    traits in order that you may be prepared to receive him or not
    on his return, as you think best. I am sure he would prefer
    William Henry to sleep at in preference to Montreal.</p>

  <p>After an inter-regnum of nearly three months, Sir George
  Prevost arrived at Quebec in September, and assumed the
  government of Lower Canada, having succeeded Sir James Craig in
  the chief command of the British North American provinces. The
  known mildness of his character, and the popularity of his
  administration in Nova Scotia, from which he had been just
  promoted, afforded a hope that his government of Lower Canada
  would prove more auspicious to the internal union of the people
  than that of his prede<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>cessor.
  Sir George Prevost had moreover the advantage of being, we
  believe, a Canadian born, and, as his name indicates, his family
  was doubtless of French origin, a circumstance which the French
  Canadians could not fail to appreciate. Soon after his arrival,
  Major-General Brock, in addition to the command of the troops,
  was appointed president and administrator of the government in
  Upper Canada, to which office he succeeded on the 9th October,
  1811, in place of Lieut.-Governor Gore, who returned to England
  on leave. At the close of the year, his royal highness the duke
  of York expressed at length every inclination to gratify
  Major-General Brock's wishes for more active employment in
  Europe, and Sir George Prevost was authorized to replace him by
  another officer; but when the permission reached Canada, early in
  1812, a war with the United States was evidently near at hand,
  and Major-General Brock, with such a prospect, was retained both
  by honor and inclination in the country.</p>

    <p>I have a letter from Thornton of the 2d of August; the party
    arrived at Deal on the 27th of July. Sir James (Craig) bore the
    passage remarkably well, and he has received the most
    flattering and satisfactory assurances that his conduct, civil
    and military, has met with the most unqua<a name="Page_97" id=
    "Page_97"></a>lified approbation. Kempt has experienced a very
    honorable reception: the duke told him he would give him a
    <i>carte blanche</i> as to his future destination; he has
    requested to have a brigade under Lord Wellington, and was
    preparing to go to the Peninsula. Thornton does not allude to
    the probability of its effecting his present post, as he says
    Kempt writes to you at length, and will tell you of himself.
    Ellice<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> has found great
    difficulty in effecting an exchange. Dalrymple, Sir Hew's
    eldest son, had no objection till he found that the duke set
    his face against the continued exchange of that post, and that
    he would not permit it to be made a mere stepping stone for the
    brevet rank. He in consequence declined it, and Ellice is on
    the hunt for a lazy married major of dragoons, who has no
    objection to obtain it as a fixture. Thornton has been
    appointed to a regiment, but he neglects to mention the number,
    although he enters into a long explanation respecting it, viz.
    that it is of two battalions, the second in Portugal and the
    first in the East Indies, but, by a recent regulation, the
    senior lieutenant-colonel has the option of remaining in
    command of the second in Portugal if he chooses. Thornton has
    obtained leave to go, in the first instance, to his corps in
    Portugal, so as to endeavour to persuade his senior that India
    is a more desirable quarter: if he fails in his rhetoric, he
    expects shortly to travel that route himself.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The following paragraph is copied verbatim <a name="Page_98"
  id="Page_98"></a>from Thornton's letter; he is connected with
  Torrens and in habits of familiar intimacy, so that I am inclined
  to think he draws his inference from that quarter: "Pray give a
  hint in private to Generals Brock and Sheaffe, that if the former
  were to ask for a brigade at home, or on European service, and
  the latter to be put on the staff in Canada, I am almost certain
  they would succeed."</p>

    much satisfaction from the power of complying with your wishes
    as far as my situation might enable me to facilitate the
    accomplishment of the object you have expressed of returning to
    England.</p>

    <p>I have made known your wishes to the commander-in-chief, and

    with them. But until another officer shall join the station,
    you will be readily aware of the difficulty his royal highness

    otherwise, during the present state of public affairs with the
    American government.</p>

    <p>Should you wish, however, to quit the Canadian staff with a
    view to serve in Europe, his royal highness will not object to
    your return to this country, under the arrangement of your
    being immediately succeeded by another officer. And <a name=

    spot, and has strong claims to employment on the staff, his
    royal highness will have no objection to furnish Sir George
    Prevost with an authority to employ that officer in your room,
    provided he has not yet left Canada.</p>

    <p>We fortunately received yesterday the last batch of recruits
    for the 41st regiment, as from the present state of the weather
    and appearance of the river, I fear their situation would have
    been very desperate. They have, poor devils, been sixteen weeks
    and four days on their passage, and have suffered much from
    dysentery. Four men have died, and several are sick; but as the
    former detachment recovered fast when landed and taken care of,
    I doubt not that these will also: they amount to three hundred,
    and are in general very fine young men. What a noble battalion
    they will make when brought together; and the officers say that
    about 200 more were left at the dep&ocirc;t, for want of room
    in the transport.</p>

    <p>What do you think of the president's speech? In any

    could have <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>been expected,
    in the relation of the affair of the Little Belt, by accusing
    that poor little sloop of a wanton act of aggression by
    attacking a huge American frigate, when Commodore Rodgers
    himself admits that he was for nearly eight hours the chasing
    vessel.</p>

    <p>Governor Gore has revived the formation of the Glengary

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Lieut.-General Sir G. Prevost,
  Bart., at Quebec</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, December 2, 1811.</p>

    <p>The information contained in the message of the president to
    congress, relative to the existing differences between England
    and the United States, will justify, I presume to think, the
    adoption of such precautionary measures as may be necessary to
    meet all future exigencies. Under this impression, I beg leave
    to submit to your excellency such observations as occur to me,
    to enable you to <a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>form a
    correct judgment; of the actual state of this province.</p>

    <p>The military force which heretofore occupied the frontier
    posts being so inadequate to their defence, a general opinion
    prevailed that no opposition, in the event of hostilities, was
    intended. The late increase of ammunition and every species of
    stores, the substitution of a strong regiment, and the
    appointment of a military person to administer the government,
    have tended to infuse other sentiments among the most
    reflecting part of the community; and I feel happy in being
    able to assure your excellency, that during my visit last week
    at Niagara, I received the most satisfactory professions of a
    determination on the part of the principal inhabitants to exert
    every means in their power in the defence of their property and
    support of the government. They look with confidence to your
    excellency for such additional aid as may be necessary, in
    conjunction with the militia, to repel any hostile attempt
    against this province.</p>

    <p>I shall beg leave to refer your excellency to the
    communications of Lieut.-Governor Gore with Sir James Craig,
    for a correct view of the temper and composition of the militia
    and Indians. Although perfectly aware of the number of improper
    characters who have obtained extensive possessions, and whose
    principles diffuse a spirit of insubordination very adverse to
    all military institutions, I am however well assured that a
    large majority would prove faithful. It is certain that the
    best <a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>policy to be pursued,
    should future circumstances call for active preparations, will
    be to act with the utmost liberality, and as if no mistrust
    existed; for, unless the inhabitants give an active and
    efficient aid, it will be utterly impossible for the very
    limited number of the military, who are likely to be employed,
    to preserve the province.</p>

    <p>The first point to which I am anxious to call your
    excellency's attention, is the district of Amherstburg. I
    consider it the most important, and, if supplied with the means
    of commencing active operations, must deter any offensive
    attempt on this province, from Niagara westward. The American
    government will be compelled to secure their western frontier
    from the inroads of the Indians, and this cannot be effected
    without a very considerable force. But before we can expect an
    active co-operation on the part of the Indians, the reduction
    of Detroit and Michilimakinack must convince that people, who
    conceive themselves to have been sacrificed, in 1794,<a name=
    "FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> to our policy, that
    we are earnestly engaged in the war. The Indians, I am made to
    understand, are eager for an opportunity to avenge the numerous
    injuries of which they complain. A few tribes, at the
    instigation of a Shawnese,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id=
    "FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class=
    "fnanchor">[41]</a> of no particular note, have already,
    although explicitly told not to look for assistance from us,
    commenced the contest. The stand which they continue to make
    upon the Wabash, against <a name="Page_103" id=
    "Page_103"></a>about 2,000 Americans, including militia and
    regulars, is a strong proof of the large force which a general
    combination of the Indians will render necessary to protect so
    widely extended a frontier.</p>

    <p>The garrisons of Detroit and Michilimakinack do not, I
    believe, exceed seventy rank and file each; but the former can
    be easily reinforced by the militia in the neighbourhood,
    which, though not numerous, would be ample for its defence,
    unless assailed by a force much superior to any we can now
    command. The Americans will probably draw their principal
    force, either for offence or defence, from the Ohio, an
    enterprising, hardy race, and uncommonly expert on horseback
    with the rifle. This species of force is formidable to the
    Indians, although, according to reports which have reached me
    by different channels, but not official, they lately repelled
    an attack of some magnitude. Unless a diversion, such as I have
    suggested, be made, an overwhelming force will probably be
    directed against this part of the province. The measure will,
    however, be attended with a heavy expense, especially in the
    article of provision, for, not only the Indians who take the
    field, but their families, must be maintained.</p>

    <p>The numeral force of the militia in the vicinity of
    Amherstburg exceeds by a trifle seven hundred rank and file;
    consequently, very little assistance can be derived from that
    source in any offensive operation. Should, therefore, the
    aspect of affairs hereafter give stronger indications of a
    rupture, <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>I propose
    augmenting the garrison of Amherstburg with two hundred rank
    and file from Fort George and York. Such a measure I consider
    essentially necessary, were it only calculated to rouse the
    energy of the militia and Indians, who are now impressed with a
    firm belief, that in the event of war they are to be left to
    their fate. Great pains have been taken to instil this idea
    into their minds, and no stronger argument could be employed
    than the weak state of that garrison.</p>

    <p>The army now assembled upon the Wabash, with the ostensible
    view of opposing the Shawnese, is a strong additional motive in
    my mind in support of this measure; for I have no doubt that,
    the instant their service in the field terminates, a large
    portion of the regulars will be detached to strengthen the
    garrison of Detroit. I have prepared Colonel Proctor for such
    an event, and after weighing the inconvenience to which the
    service would be exposed if the district were placed under a
    militia colonel, (an event obvious, unless superseded by a
    regular officer of equal rank) I have directed Lieut.-Colonel
    St. George to be in readiness to repair to Amherstburg and
    assume the command; and I hope his situation of inspector of
    militia will not be considered a bar to the arrangement. The
    state of the roads will probably stop this projected movement
    until the end of this month or beginning of the next; nor do I
    intend that the troops should leave their present quarters,
    unless urged by some fresh circumstances. I therefore <a name=
    "Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>look to receive your excellency's
    commands previous to their departure.</p>

    <p>From Amherstburg to Fort Erie, my chief dependance must rest
    on a naval force for the protection of that extensive coast;
    but, considering the state to which it is reduced,
    extraordinary exertions and great expense will be required
    before it can be rendered efficient. At present, it consists
    only of a ship and a small schooner&mdash;the latter of a bad
    construction, old, and in want of many repairs; yet she is the
    only king's vessel able to navigate Lake Huron, whilst the
    Americans have a sloop, and a fine brig capable of carrying
    twelve guns, both in perfect readiness for any service. If,
    consequently, the garrison of St. Joseph's is to be maintained,
    and an attack on Michilimakinack undertaken, it will be
    expedient to hire, or purchase from the merchants, as many
    vessels as may be necessary for the purpose. The Americans can
    resort to the same means, and the construction and number of
    their vessels for trade will give them great advantage:
    besides, their small craft, or boats, in which troops could be
    easily transported, exceed ours considerably; indeed, we have
    very few of that description. I therefore leave it to your
    excellency's superior judgment to determine whether a
    sufficient number of gun-boats for both lakes, so constructed
    as to draw little water, ought not be added to our means of
    offence and defence. It is worthy of remark, that the only
    American national vessel on Lake Ontario, built two years ago,
    and <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>now lying in Sackett's
    harbour, has remained without seamen until within the last
    fortnight, when the officers began to enter men as fast as
    possible. A lieutenant with a party came to Buffalo, a
    tolerably large village opposite Fort Erie, and procured
    several hands, but, not satisfied, a petty officer was sent to
    our side to inveigle others. The magistrates, hearing of this,
    sent to apprehend him; but he escaped with difficulty.</p>

    <p>The strait between Niagara and Fort Erie is that which, in
    all probability, will be chosen by the Americans for their main
    body to penetrate with a view to conquest. All other attacks
    will be subordinate, or merely made to divert our attention.
    About three thousand militia could, upon an emergency, be drawn
    by us to that line, and nearly five hundred Indians could also
    be collected; therefore, with the regulars, no trifling force
    could hope for success, provided a determined resistance were
    made; but I cannot conceal from your excellency, that unless a
    strong regular force be present to animate the loyal and to
    control the disaffected, nothing effectual can be expected. A
    protracted resistance upon this frontier will be sure to
    embarrass the enemy's plans materially. They will not come
    prepared to meet it, and their troops, or volunteer corps,
    without scarcely any discipline, so far at least as control is
    in question, will soon tire under disappointment. The
    difficulty which they will experience in providing provisions
    will involve them in expenses, under which their government
    will soon become impatient.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>The car brigade will be
    particularly useful in obstructing their passage; and I cannot
    be too urgent in soliciting the means, both as to gunners and
    drivers, and likewise as to horses, to render this arm complete
    for service. A small body of cavalry would also be absolutely
    necessary, and I have already offers from many respectable
    young men, to form themselves into a troop. All they seem to
    require are swords and pistols, which the stores below may
    probably be able to furnish.</p>

    <p>The situation of Kingston is so very important in every
    military point of view, that I cannot be too earnest in drawing
    your excellency's attention to that quarter. The militia, from
    the Bay of Quinti down to Glengary, is the most respectable of
    any in the province. Among the officers several are on half
    pay, and still retain a sound military spirit. Those from the
    Bay of Quinti would be properly stationed at Kingston, but all
    downwards would naturally desire to be employed to resist any
    predatory excursions to which their property would be so much
    exposed from the opposite shore. Besides, I have always been of
    opinion that a strong detachment would follow the route of Lord
    Amherst, and attempt to enter the province by
    Ozwegatchie.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id=
    "FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class=
    "fnanchor">[42]</a> The militia on the whole of that
    communication cannot, therefore, be more usefully employed than
    in watching such a movement; and should the enemy direct the
    whole of his force <a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>by St.
    John's, the greater part can with the utmost facility join the
    army acting upon that frontier.</p>

    <p>The militia act, which I have the honor to enclose, provides
    for such an emergency, but your excellency will readily
    observe, that among many wise and salutary provisions, there
    are but few means of enforcing them. No exertions, however,
    shall be wanting in my civil capacity to place that body upon a
    respectable footing. Mr. Cartwright, the senior militia colonel
    at Kingston, possesses the influence to which his firm
    character and superior abilities so deservedly entitle him; but
    as I cannot possibly give the necessary attention to so distant
    an object, and as a regular officer will be indispensable to
    direct the operations, one of high rank ought, if possible, to
    be nominated to that command. So much will remain to be done,
    and such high expenses to be incurred in the
    quartermaster-general's departments, that I cannot too
    earnestly request your excellency to select an officer who may
    be equal to discharge the various duties of that office. A head
    to the commissariat will be likewise indispensable.</p>

    <p>I have trespassed greatly on your excellency's time, but I
    beg to be permitted to entreat your excellency to honor me with
    such advice and counsel as your experience may suggest, and be
    assured it will ever be my utmost pride to meet your views and
    to merit your approbation.</p>

    <p>My first care, on my arrival in this province, was to direct

    their whole influence with the Indians to prevent the attack
    which I understood a few tribes meditated against the American

    infatuation of the Indians, that they refused to listen to
    advice; and they are now so deeply engaged, that I despair of
    being able to withdraw them from the contest in time to avert
    their destruction. A high degree of fanaticism, which had been
    for years working in their minds, has led to the present

    establishing dep&ocirc;ts of small arms, accoutrements and
    ammunition, at the different posts in Upper Canada.</p>

    <p>Since the settlement of the province, several hundred stands
    have been at different times issued to the militia, and I have
    given directions for collecting them, but in all probability
    great deficien<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>cies will be
    found; indeed, it has already been ascertained that those
    delivered in 1795 by the late Lieut.-General Simcoe are wholly
    lost to the service. To obviate for the future such an
    extensive waste, I propose fixing upon proper places at each
    post, wherein the arms may be deposited after the militia have
    exercised; and I have to request your excellency's permission
    to direct the field train department to attend to their
    preservation, and keep them in a state of repair, in the same
    manner as those remaining in store. The expense cannot be
    great, and in all such cases the infant state of the country
    obliges the militia to have recourse to the military.</p>

    <p>I have recently had occasion to report for your excellency's
    information, the total want of stores at this post, beyond
    those immediately necessary for the commissariat. I shall
    consequently be much at a loss to find accommodation for the
    2,329 French muskets which your excellency has directed to be
    sent here; and as the only magazine is a small wooden shed, not
    sixty yards from the king's house, which is rendered dangerous
    from the quantity of powder it already contains, I cannot but
    feel a repugnance to lodge the additional 13,140 ball
    cartridges intended for this post in a place so evidently
    insecure. But as these arrangements cannot conveniently take
    place until the opening of the navigation, there will be
    sufficient time to contrive the best means to meet your
    excellency's wishes.</p>

    <p>[OFFICIAL]</p>

    <p>I am directed to transmit herewith a copy of proposals for
    raising a corps of Glengary Fencibles. The commander of the
    forces has selected an officer of the king's regiment, a
    Captain George M'Donnell, an avowed catholic, and a relation of
    the Glengary priest of that name, to attempt the formation of a
    small battalion, to be in the first instance under his command
    with the rank of major; and in case a more respectable body can
    be collected, a lieutenant-colonel commandant will be
    appointed. Captain M'Donnell will leave this in a few days, and
    he will be directed to take an early opportunity of
    communicating with you as soon as he has felt his ground a
    little in Glengary, and is able to form a correct idea of the
    prospect and extent of success that is likely to attend his
    exertions.</p>

    <p>I shall have the honor of sending you by the next post a
    regulation for the payment of clergymen performing religious
    duties for the troops at the different stations in Canada. The
    officiating clergyman at York will receive the garrison
    allowances of a captain, together with a salary of &pound;70
    army sterling per annum.</p>

    <p>[PRIVATE.]</p>

    <p>Sir George will fill up the new Glengary corps with as many
    officers as he can from the line, with permanent rank, and I
    have availed myself of the opportunity to propose one, in whose
    advancement <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>I know you
    feel an interest. He has allowed me to note Lieutenant Shaw, of
    the 49th, for a company, and you are at liberty to inform his
    father, the general, of Sir George's favorable intentions
    towards his son.</p>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, December 24, 1811.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
    of the 2d instant, which reached me by the courier on Saturday,
    and I have not failed to give it that consideration which the
    importance of the several points, to which it alludes, entitles
    it.</p>

    <p>In addition to the president's message being full of
    gunpowder, the report made to congress by its committee on the
    state of the foreign affairs of the United States, conveys
    sentiments of such decided hostility towards England, that I
    feel justified in recommending such precaution as may place you
    in a state of preparation for that event; and with this view
    you must endeavour to trace an outline of co-operation,
    compensating for our deficiency in strength. I agree with you
    as to the advantages which may result from giving, rather than
    receiving, the first blow; but it is not my opinion war will
    commence by a declaration of it. That act would militate
    against the policy of both countries; therefore, we must expect
    repeated petty aggressions from our neighbours, before we are
    permitted to retaliate by open hostilities. It is very
    satisfactory to observe the professions of <a name="Page_113"
    id="Page_113"></a>the inhabitants of Upper Canada in defence of
    their property and in support of their government.</p>

    <p>I will look into the correspondence you refer to, which took
    place between Sir James Craig and Lieut.-Governor Gore, in
    1807, 1808 and 1809, respecting the temper and disposition of
    your militia, and the policy to be observed in your intercourse
    with the Indians.</p>

    <p>Your views, in regard to the line of conduct to be observed
    towards the militia forces, notwithstanding some existing
    circumstances unfavorable in their composition, are in my
    estimation wise, and on such conceptions I have hitherto
    acted.</p>

    <p>There are too many considerations to allow me to hesitate in
    saying we must employ the Indians, if they can be brought to
    act with us. The utmost caution should be used in our language
    to them, and all direct explanation should be delayed, if
    possible, until hostilities are more certain; though whenever
    the subject is adverted to, I think it would be advisable
    always to intimate that, as a matter of course, we shall, in
    the event of war, expect the aid of our brothers. Although I am
    sensible this requires delicacy, still it should be done so as
    not to be misunderstood.</p>

    <p>I shall call the attention of the commissariat to the supply
    of provisions that may be required in the Upper Province; and I
    had, previously to the arrival of your letter, given directions
    for the building of another schooner for Lake Erie.</p>

  <p>Our memoir having now reached the year 1812, in which the
  United States of America declared war against Great Britain, we
  proceed to give a brief review of the causes which led to that
  event; and in doing so it will be necessary to go back to the
  commencement of the century.</p>

  <p>The first president of America, the immortal
  Washington,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id=
  "FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class=
  "fnanchor">[43]</a> and his successor, Adams, entertained
  friendly sentiments towards the British government and people;
  but early in 1801, Jefferson succeeded the latter functionary as
  president, being elected by ten of the sixteen states then
  constituting the Union. Jefferson was as inimical to England as
  he was favorable to France, so was his secretary of state, and
  successor in the presidential chair, Madison. Although there were
  many intervenient heart-burnings, it was not until the year 1807,
  when Jefferson was a second time president, that the government
  of the United States assumed a decidedly hostile attitude towards
  Great Britain. The Berlin decree, in which the French ruler
  ventured to declare the British islands in a <a name="Page_115"
  id="Page_115"></a>state of blockade, and to interdict all
  neutrals from trading with the British ports in any commodities
  whatever, produced fresh retaliatory orders in council, intended
  to support England's maritime rights and commerce, and to
  counteract Bonaparte's continental system. The Berlin decree was
  a gross infringement of the law of nations and an outrage on
  neutral rights, which especially called for resistance from the
  Americans, a neutral and trading people; but they neither
  resisted nor seriously remonstrated against it. Other causes of
  dispute arose from the determination of the British government to
  exclude the Americans from the blockaded ports of France, and
  from that inexhaustible source of quarrel, the impressment of
  British seamen from American vessels, especially as the
  difficulty of distinguishing British from American seamen led
  occasionally to the impressment of American native born citizens.
  In June, 1807, occurred the rencontre between his majesty's ship
  Leopard and the Chesapeake, which terminated in the forcible
  extraction from the American frigate of four deserters from
  British ships of war. The British government instantly disavowed
  this act, and recalled Vice-Admiral Berkeley, who had given the
  order to search the Chesapeake. Jefferson, however, not only
  issued a proclamation interdicting all British ships of war from
  entering the ports of the United States, but proposed to congress
  to lay an embargo on American vessels, and to compel the trading
  ships of every other <a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>nation
  to quit the American harbours. This proposition was warmly
  opposed by the federalists, or Washingtonians, but it was
  nevertheless adopted by large majorities. Thus matters remained,
  with subsequent slight modifications, from the month of December,
  1807, to the declaration of war in 1812, an interval which the
  commercial classes spent in a hopeless struggle against
  bankruptcy and ruin. Attempts were not wanting on our part to
  arrive at a friendly accommodation, but Jefferson demanded, as a
  preliminary, the revocation of the British orders in council, and
  the entire exemption of American ships from any search, or from
  any question as to their crews or cargoes. The British government
  pledged itself to repeal the orders in council as soon as the
  French decrees should cease to exist. In 1809, Jefferson was
  succeeded as president by Madison, who was compelled to yield
  somewhat to the popular outcry, and to repeal the universal
  embargo substituting a non-intercourse act with England and
  France, both which nations, it must be confessed, having by
  restraints on their commerce given the Americans just grounds for
  dissatisfaction. On the 23d June, 1812, the prince regent in
  council revoked the orders in council as far as regarded America,
  with a proviso that the revocation should be of no effect unless
  the United States rescinded their non-intercourse act with
  England. It has been thought that the revocation came too late,
  and that if it had been conceded a few weeks earlier, there would
  have <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>been no war with
  America; but Madison had been treating with Bonaparte's
  government since the end of the year 1810, and the whole course
  of his conduct, with his evident desire to illustrate his
  presidency by the conquest of Canada, proved his determination to
  brave a war with England. He and his party nicely calculated on
  which side the greater profit was to be obtained&mdash;whether
  the United States would gain more by going to war with England
  than by hostility against Bonaparte and his edicts. "Every thing
  in the United States," says James in his naval history, "was to
  be settled by a calculation of profit and loss. France had
  numerous allies&mdash;England scarcely any. France had no
  contiguous territory; England had the Canadas ready to be marched
  into at a moment's notice. France had no commerce; England had
  richly-laden merchantmen traversing every sea. England,
  therefore, it was against whom the death-blows of America were to
  be levelled." The struggles of England against Napoleon enabled
  the American government to choose its own time. On the 14th
  April, congress laid an embargo on all ships and vessels of the
  United States during the space of ninety days, with the view of
  lessening the number that would be at the mercy of England when
  war was finally declared, and also of manning efficiently their
  ships of war and privateers. By the end of May their fastest
  merchant vessels were converted into cruisers, ready to start at
  a short notice. On the 18th of <a name="Page_118" id=
  "Page_118"></a>June, before the revocation of the orders in
  council was known in the United States, a declaration of war was
  carried in the house of representatives by seventy-nine to
  forty-nine votes, its supporters being chiefly from the western
  and southern states to Pennsylvania inclusive, while the
  advocates for peace were principally from the northern and
  eastern states.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id=

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, January 22, 1812.</p>

    <p>It is the opinion of the adjutant-general that you will not
    wish to avail yourself of the conditional leave of absence I
    have received authority to grant you. I shall hear with
    particular satisfaction that Baynes is not mistaken, as I value
    your services highly.</p>

    <p>If it be the disposition of government to employ
    Major-General Sheaffe, the death of Major-General Balfour, at
    Fredericton, and the absence of Major-General Wilder, affords
    the opportunity of doing so without depriving me of your
    assistance at this critical period of affairs.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock, at York.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, January 23, 1812<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
    "FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class=
    "fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

    <p>Sir George Prevost has commissioned me to inform you that by
    the October mail, which arrived two days ago, he received a
    letter from the adju<a name="Page_119" id=
    "Page_119"></a>tant-general, authorizing him to permit your
    return to England for the purpose of being employed on the
    continent, and sanctioning his appointing Major-General Sheaffe
    to succeed you on the staff in Canada. But Sir George, viewing
    the intention of the commander-in-chief as instigated solely by
    a desire to promote your wishes and advantage, and having
    learnt from me that from the tenor of your recent
    correspondence I was led to believe that you would prefer
    retaining your present charge, he has directed me to inform you
    of the circumstance by a private letter, which will enable you
    to canvass the subject with more freedom than an official
    communication would admit of. Your decision to remain longer in
    Canada will be highly acceptable to him. Sheaffe, I have no
    doubt, will be very speedily provided for in this country,
    without depriving us of your services. Sir George has asked
    permission to appoint him in General Wilder's place, and there
    will be two vacancies in Nova Scotia to fill up in the
    spring.</p>

    <p>Sir George has great pleasure in acceding to your request to
    be permitted to nominate one or two ensigns to the Glengary
    Fencibles, and, if you wish, young Shaw may be immediately
    provided for in that corps, and afterwards transferred to the
    line.</p>

    <p>The cold here has been severer for the last eight days than
    has ever been recollected by the oldest inhabitant; the
    thermometer falling as low as 33 degrees under cipher,
    accompanied with high wind, and <a name="Page_120" id=
    "Page_120"></a>never rising during all that time above 15
    degrees below&mdash;it is at this moment 20 degrees under
    cipher: fortunate you, that are in a milder climate, for we are
    suffering dreadfully from excessive cold. By your description
    of your pastime in shooting wild pigeons, you certainly possess
    a very great advantage over us in these respects. We have been
    much plagued with opthalmia, which has been very general in the
    king's regiment, and the severe cold does not prevent the
    contagion.</p>
  </div>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>On the 4th February, 1812, Major-General Brock, accompanied by
  a numerous suite, opened the session of the legislature at York
  with the following speech to the legislative council and the
  house of assembly:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Honorable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and
    Gentlemen of the House of Assembly.</p>

    <p>"I should derive the utmost satisfaction, the first time of
    my addressing you, were it permitted me to direct your
    attention solely to such objects as tended to promote the peace
    and prosperity of this province.</p>

    <p>"The glorious contest in which the British empire is
    engaged, and the vast sacrifice which Great Britain nobly
    offers to secure the independence of other nations, might be
    expected to stifle every feeling of envy and jealousy, and at
    the same time to excite the interest and command the admiration
    of a free people; but, regardless of such generous impressions,
    the American government evinces a disposition calculated to
    impede and divide her efforts.</p>

    <p>"England is not only interdicted the harbours of the United
    States, while they afford a shelter to the cruisers of her
    inveterate enemy, but she is likewise required to <a name=
    "Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>resign those maritime rights which
    she has so long exercised and enjoyed. Insulting threats are
    offered, and hostile preparations actually commenced; and
    though not without hope that cool reflection and the dictates
    of justice may yet avert the calamities of war, I cannot, under
    every view of the relative situation of the province, be too
    urgent in recommending to your early attention the adoption of
    such measures as will best secure the internal peace of the
    country, and defeat every hostile aggression.</p>

    <p>"Principally composed of the sons of a loyal and brave band
    of veterans, the militia, I am confident, stand in need of
    nothing but the necessary legislative provisions, to direct
    their ardour in the acquirement of military instruction, to
    form a most efficient force.</p>

    <p>"The growing prosperity of these provinces, it is manifest,
    begins to awaken a spirit of envy and ambition. The
    acknowledged importance of this colony to the parent state will
    secure the continuance of her powerful protection. Her
    fostering care has been the first cause, under Providence, of
    the uninterrupted happiness you have so long enjoyed. Your
    industry has been liberally rewarded, and you have in
    consequence risen to opulence.</p>

    <p>"These interesting truths are not uttered to animate your
    patriotism, but to dispel any apprehension which you may have
    imbibed of the possibility of England forsaking you; for you
    must be sensible that if once bereft of her support, if once
    deprived of the advantages which her commerce and the supply of
    her most essential wants give you, this colony, from its
    geographical position, must inevitably sink into comparative
    poverty and insignificance.</p>

    <p>"But Heaven will look favorably on the manly exertions which
    the loyal and virtuous inhabitants of this happy land are
    prepared to make, to avert such a dire calamity.</p>

    <p>"Our gracious prince, who so gloriously upholds the <a name=
    "Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>dignity of the empire, already
    appreciates your merit, and it will be your first care to
    establish, by the course of your actions, the just claim of the
    country to the protection of his royal highness.</p>

    <p>"I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of announcing to you
    from this place, the munificent intention of his royal highness
    the prince regent, who has been graciously pleased to signify
    that a grant of &pound;100 per annum will be proposed in the
    annual estimates, for every future missionary of the Gospel,
    sent from England, who may have faithfully discharged, for the
    term of ten years, the duties of his station in this
    province.</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>

    <p>"I have no doubt but that, with me, you are convinced of the
    necessity of a regular system of military instruction to the
    militia of this province;&mdash;on this salutary precaution, in
    the event of a war, our future safety will greatly depend, and
    I doubt not but that you will cheerfully lend your aid, to
    enable me to defray the expense of carrying into effect a
    measure so conducive to our security and defence.</p>

    <p>"I have ordered the public accounts to be laid before you,
    and have no doubt but that you will consider them with that
    attention which the nature of the subject may require.</p>

    <p>"Honorable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and
    Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>

    <p>"I have, without reserve, communicated to you what has
    occurred to me on the existing circumstances of this province.
    We wish and hope for peace, but it is nevertheless our duty to
    be prepared for war.</p>

    <p>"The task imposed on you, on the present occasion, is
    arduous; this task, however, I hope and trust, laying aside
    every consideration but that of the public good, you will
    perform with that firmness, discretion, and promptitude, which
    a regard to yourselves, your families, your country, and your
    king, call for at your hands.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>As for myself, it
    shall be my utmost endeavour to co-operate with you in
    promoting such measures as may best contribute to the security
    and to the prosperity of this province."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The addresses of the provincial parliament in reply were
  highly satisfactory, and in answer Major-General Brock
  observed:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"The congratulations offered upon my appointment to the
    honorable station I hold in this province, and the confidence
    you so early repose in me, are, be assured, received with pride
    and heartfelt satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"Impressed with the assurance of your support, I feel a most
    perfect reliance that the exertions of this province will be
    found equal to meet every emergency of this important
    crisis."</p>

  Major-General Brock's views and intentions in the probable event
  of a war ensuing between Great Britain and the United States, and
  which a few months afterwards he carried into effect with a
  success that must have exceeded his most sanguine
  expectations.</p>

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Colonel Baynes, the
  Adj.-General.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, February 12, 1812.</p>

    <p>The assurance which I gave, in my speech at the opening of
    the legislature, of England co-operating in the defence of this
    province, has infused the utmost confidence; and I have reason
    at this moment to look for the acquiescence of the two houses
    to every measure I may think necessary to recom<a name=
    "Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>mend for the peace and defence of
    the country. A spirit has manifested itself, little expected by
    those who conceived themselves the best qualified to judge of
    the disposition of the members of the house of assembly. The
    most powerful opponents to Governor Gore's administration take
    the lead on the present occasion. I, of course, do not think it
    expedient to damp the ardour displayed by these once doubtful
    characters. Some opposed Mr. Gore evidently from personal
    motives, but never forfeited the right of being numbered among
    the most loyal. Few, very few I believe, were actuated by base
    or unworthy considerations, however mistaken they may have been
    on various occasions. Their character will very soon be put to
    a severe test. The measures which I intend to propose are:</p>

    <p>1.&mdash;A militia supplementary act. Sir George will hear
    the outlines from Captain Gray.</p>

    <p>2.&mdash;The suspension of the habeas corpus. A copy of the
    act now enforced in the Lower Province.</p>

    <p>3.&mdash;An alien law.</p>

    <p>4.&mdash;The offer of a reward for the better apprehension
    of deserters.</p>

    <p>If I succeed in all this, I shall claim some praise; but I
    am not without my fears. I shall send you the militia act the
    moment it passes into a law. The more I consider the new
    provisions, the more I am satisfied (giving of course every
    <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>proper allowance to the
    disposition of the people) they are peculiarly calculated to
    meet the local situation of the country. I have not a musket
    more than will suffice to arm the active part of the militia
    from Kingston westward. I have therefore to request that the
    number of arms may be sent, according to the enclosed
    requisition, to the places therein specified, on the
    communication between Glengary and Kingston. Every man capable
    of carrying a musket, along the whole of that line, ought to be
    prepared to act. The members of the assembly from that part of
    the country are particularly anxious that some works may be
    thrown up as a rallying point and place of security for stores,
    &amp;c, in the vicinity of Johnstown. I shall request Colonel
    M'Donnell to examine, on his return, the ground which those
    gentlemen recommend as best suited for that purpose. Being
    immediately opposite Ozwegatchie, some precaution of the sort
    is indispensable, were it only to preserve a free communication
    between the two provinces. I have been made to expect the able
    assistance of Captain Marlow. Should he be still at Quebec,
    have the goodness to direct his attention, on his way up, to
    that quarter. He had better consult. Colonel Frazer and Captain
    Gilkinson, men of sound judgment and well acquainted with the
    country. The militia will have of course to be employed on the
    works.</p>

    <p>I must still press the necessity of an active, enterprizing,
    intelligent commander being stationed <a name="Page_126" id=
    "Page_126"></a>on that important line of communication. I wish
    Colonel Ellice<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id=
    "FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class=
    "fnanchor">[46]</a> were here to undertake the arduous task, as
    it is wholly impossible that I can do so. Every assistance in
    my civil capacity I shall always be ready to give, and to that
    point my exertions must be necessarily limited. Niagara and
    Amherstburg will sufficiently occupy my attention. I deliver my
    sentiments freely, believing they will not be the less
    acceptable.</p>

    <p>I discussed every point connected with Amherstburg so
    completely with Captain Gray, that I do not find any thing very
    essential was omitted. Colonel M'Donnell will be able probably
    to give us further insight as to the actual state of affairs
    there. He was to make every enquiry and, as far as he was
    permitted, to judge himself of the relative strength of
    Detroit. Lieut.-Colonel&mdash;&mdash; preceded him by some
    days, but in such state of mind that forbids my placing any
    dependance in his exertions. When I first mentioned my
    intention of sending him to Amherstburg, he seemed diffident of
    his abilities, but pleased at the distinction. However, when he
    received his final instructions, his conduct in the presence of
    some officers was so very improper, and otherwise so childish,
    that I have since written to say, if he continued in the same
    disposition, he was at liberty to return to Niagara. I did not
    directly order him back, because at this <a name="Page_127" id=
    "Page_127"></a>time I consider an officer of rank necessary at
    Amherstburg, particularly during the absence of Messrs. Elliott
    and Baby, who are both here attending their parliamentary
    duties. You will imagine, after what I have stated, that it is
    the influence of his rank I alone covet, and not his personal
    aid. He has very fortunately given timely proof that he is in
    no way ambitious of military fame, therefore unfit for so
    important a command. Should it please his excellency to place
    the 41st and 49th at my disposal, I propose sending the former
    regiment to Amherstburg, as we cannot be too strong in that
    quarter. I have already explained myself on that point, and
    Captain Gray is furnished with further arguments in support of
    the measure. I have delayed to the last the mention of a
    project which I consider of the utmost consequence in the event
    of hostilities. I set out with declaring my full conviction,
    that unless Detroit and Michilimakinack be both in our
    possession immediately at the commencement of hostilities, not
    only the district of Amherstburg, but most probably the whole
    country as far as Kingston, must be evacuated. How necessary,
    therefore, to provide effectually the means of their capture.
    From Amherstburg it will be impossible to send a force to
    reduce Michilimakinack. Unless we occupy completely both banks,
    no vessel could pass the river St. Clair. What I therefore
    presume to suggest for his excellency's consideration, is the
    adoption of a project which Sir James Craig contemplated three
    years <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>ago. The north-west
    company undertook to transport 50 or 60 men up the Ottawa, and
    I make no doubt would engage again to perform the same service.
    If therefore a war be likely to occur, at the time the canoes
    start from Montreal, I should recommend 40 or 50 of the 49th
    light company, and a small detachment of artillery, embarking
    at the same time for St. Joseph's. Should hostilities commence,
    the north-west would not object to join their strength in the
    reduction of Michilimakinack; and should peace succeed the
    present wrangling, the 49th detachment could be easily removed
    to Amherstburg.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, February 20, 1812.</p>

    <p>Captain M'Donnell has not clearly understood the purport of
    his mission to Upper Canada, and the general regrets that he
    should have proceeded the length he has done without having
    previously received your advice and instructions, to obtain
    which was the chief object of his visit to York. It is to be
    hoped, however, that sufficient patronage still remains open to
    meet your wishes, as the appointment of three of General Shaw's
    sons may be considered, from the sentiments of friendship and
    regard you have testified for that officer, to be almost
    equivalent to anticipating your own choice of them. And Sir
    George has directed me to inform you, that he readily accepts
    of your proposal to recruit two companies, to be added to the
    <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>Glengary Fencibles; the
    nomination of the officers, viz. two captains, two lieutenants,
    and two ensigns, to rest entirely with you. The general has
    approved of the following quotas of men for the respective
    ranks: captains 30, lieutenants 15, and ensigns 20; the
    commissions to be issued on completing the quota, and such as
    complete their proportion quickest, or exceed in extra number
    of recruits, will have priority in regimental rank. I am not
    aware that Sir George purposes nominating a lieutenant-colonel;
    but I am sure that you will not feel less disposed to promote
    the formation of this corps, when I inform you that it is his
    intention to recommend me to the commander-in-chief for the
    appointment of colonel.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, February 22, 1812.</p>

    <p>Sir George is much pleased with the favorable account
    Captain Gray has given him of your proceedings. Your speech is
    highly approved of here, and we shall rejoice to find our house
    following so laudable an example as your commons have shewn
    them: but I am not sanguine; they have already commenced with
    great illiberality and violence to vent their spleen and
    resentment against Sir James (Craig) in votes of censure, and I
    fancy Sir George, with all his amiable, conciliatory mariners,
    will hardly succeed in keeping them within bounds.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><i>Major-General Brock to
  Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, February&mdash;, 1812.</p>

    <p>I cannot permit Colonel M'Donnell to return home without
    giving your excellency a short account of our proceedings
    here.</p>

    <p>I had every reason to expect the almost unanimous support of
    the two houses of the legislature to every measure the
    government thought it necessary to recommend; but after a short
    trial, I found myself egregiously mistaken in my
    calculations.</p>

    <p>The many doubtful characters in the militia made me anxious
    to introduce the oath of abjuration into the bill: there were
    twenty members in the house, when this highly important measure
    was lost by the casting voice of the chairman.</p>

    <p>The great influence which the numerous settlers from the
    United States possess over the decisions of the lower house is
    truly alarming, and ought immediately, by every practical
    means, to be diminished. To give encouragement to real subjects
    to settle in this province, can alone remove the evil. The
    consideration of the fees should not stand in the way of such a
    politic arrangement; and should your excellency ultimately
    determine to promise some of the waste lands of the crown to
    such Scotch emigrants as enlist in the Glengary Fencibles, I
    have no hesitation in recommending, in the strongest manner,
    the raising of a Canadian corps upon similar offers, to be
    hereafter disbanded and distributed among their countrymen in
    the <a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>vicinity of
    Amherstburg. Colonel M'Donnell being in full possession of my
    sentiments on this subject, I beg leave to refer your
    excellency to him for further information.</p>

    <p>The bill for the suspension of the habeas corpus, I regret
    to say, was likewise lost by a very trifling majority. A strong
    sentiment now prevails that war is not likely to occur with the
    United States, which, I believe, tended to influence the votes
    of the members; I mean of such who, though honest, are by their
    ignorance easily betrayed into error.</p>

    <p>The low ebb of their finances appears to stagger the most
    desperate democrats in the States, and may possibly delay the
    commencement of direct hostilities; but should France and
    England continue the contest much longer, it appears to me
    absolutely impossible for the United States to avoid making
    their election; and the unfriendly disposition they have for
    some years past evinced towards England, leaves little doubt as
    to their choice. Your excellency, I am sensible, will excuse
    the freedom with which I deliver my sentiments.</p>

    <p>Every day hostilities are retarded, the greater the
    difficulties we shall have to encounter. The Americans are at
    this moment busily employed in raising six companies of
    Rangers, for the express purpose of overawing the Indians; and
    are besides collecting a regular force at Vincennes, probably
    with a view of reinforcing Detroit. Indeed, report states the
    arrival of a large force at Fort <a name="Page_132" id=
    "Page_132"></a>Wayne, intended for the former garrison. Their
    intrigues among the different tribes are carried on openly and
    with the utmost activity, and as no expense is spared, it may
    reasonably be supposed that they do not fail of success.
    Divisions are thus uninterruptedly sowed among our Indian
    friends, and the minds of many altogether estranged from our
    interests. Such must inevitably be the consequence of our
    present inert and neutral proceedings in regard to them. It ill
    becomes me to determine how long true policy requires that the
    restrictions now imposed upon the Indian department ought to
    continue; but this I will venture to assert, that each day the
    officers are restrained from interfering in the concerns of the
    Indians, each time they advise peace and withhold the
    accustomed supply of ammunition, their influence will diminish,
    till at length they lose it altogether.</p>

    <p>I find that ever since the departure of Priest Burke from
    Sandwich, the &pound;50 per annum paid from the military chest
    to that gentleman have been withheld, on what account I have
    not been able to ascertain. The individual at present
    officiating is highly spoken of; and as several gentlemen of
    the Catholic persuasion have applied to me to intercede with
    your excellency to renew the allowance, I presume to submit the
    case to your indulgent consideration.</p>

    <p>I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your
    letter of the 12th February, which I have communicated to Sir
    George, who is highly pleased to find you are satisfied to
    retain the important post you fill, and which you appear to
    govern under such very auspicious prospects. I sincerely trust
    you will be able to keep your subjects, and particularly your
    house of representatives, in the same good humour and sound
    principles which they have hitherto testified. You will
    perceive in the main sentiments of Sir George's opening
    address, a perfect accordance with your own: the answer of the
    assembly led to a very violent and personal debate, which
    lasted with closed doors for nearly eighteen hours. It would
    have been more to their credit had they left out the allusion
    which has drawn from Sir George a very appropriate retort. Your
    friend, James Cuthbert, was very warm and eloquent upon the
    occasion, and the demagogue party seemed sensible of the
    severity of his satire, when he compared the factious cabal to
    &AElig;sop's fable of the ass kicking at the dying lion. Having
    vented their spleen, they will, I believe, prove a little more
    tractable: the militia bill has a prospect of being materially
    amended, and they will, I think, allow a proportion of about
    2,000 men, or perhaps a few more, to be incorporated for two or
    three months, for three <a name="Page_134" id=
    "Page_134"></a>successive years; after the second year to be
    replaced by a new quota, and to be selected by ballot, and no
    substitutes permitted to serve in the place of a militiaman
    drawn by lot: this will be a great point gained.</p>

    <p>I received yesterday your letter dated the 20th February,
    and have to express my thanks to Sir George Prevost for his
    readiness in attending to my wishes.</p>

    <p>His excellency having been pleased to authorize the raising
    of two companies under my superintendence, giving me the
    nomination of the officers, I have to acquaint you, for his
    information, that Alexander Roxburgh, Esq., has been appointed
    by me to raise men for a company, and William M'Lean,
    gentleman, for an ensigncy. The former is a gentleman strongly
    recommended to me by Mr. Cartwright, of Kingston; and the
    latter, the son of an officer formerly in the 25th regiment,
    who, having settled in this country, has become one of the most
    influential characters in it. He is a member of the house of
    assembly for the district of Frontenac. I have not yet
    determined in respect to the remaining commissions, but will
    report the instant the individuals are nominated.</p>

    <p>Captain Dixon (royal engineers) proceeded four days ago to
    Amherstburg, with the gentlemen who were returning from their
    parliamentary duties.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>I request you will have
    the goodness to inform me of the probable time I may expect the
    honor of seeing Sir George Prevost, as I shall consider it a
    duty, which I shall execute with the utmost pleasure, of
    meeting his excellency at Kingston.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, March 19, 1812.</p>

    <p>I regret to find by your late letters to Sir George Prevost,
    that your expectations from your legislature have not been
    realised to the extent of your well grounded hopes. Sir George,
    who is well versed in the fickle and untractable disposition of
    public assemblies, feels more regret than disappointment. He
    has a very delicate card to play with his house of assembly
    here, who would fain keep up the farce of being highly charmed
    and delighted with his amiable disposition and affable manners:
    they have even gone the length of asserting, that these traits
    in his character have afforded them the most entire confidence
    that in his hands the alien act would not be abused. They have,
    however, taken the precaution of stripping it of its very
    essence and spirit, while last year they passed it without a
    division, when Sir James, (Craig,) on whose mild and affable
    disposition they did not pretend to rely, told them that it
    could only alarm such as were conscious of harbouring seditious
    designs. They have passed an amendment to the militia bill,
    which, though not affording all that was required, is still a
    mate<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>rial point gained.
    2,000 men are to be ballotted to serve for three months in two
    successive summers; one of their strongest objections was the
    apprehension of the Canadians contracting military habits and
    enlisting into the service.[A]</p>

    <p>Sir George has directed me to inform you, that he will be
    ready to render you any assistance in his power to strengthen
    the Upper Province; but that unless reinforcements arrive from
    England, (in which case you may depend upon having a due
    proportion put under your immediate command,) his means of
    doing so are but very limited. His excellency is not sanguine
    in his expectation of receiving reinforcements this summer; on
    the contrary, the appearance of hostilities beginning to abate
    at Washington, and the pledge held out in the prince regent's
    speech of supporting with energy the contest in Spain and
    Portugal, are likely to prevent troops being sent to this
    quarter, unless a more urgent necessity of doing so should
    appear. I will not comment on American politics, in which we
    all appear to agree that the deep-rooted jealousy and hatred of
    that people must in the end lead to hostilities, and that it
    behoves us not to lose sight of an event which, if not prepared
    to meet, we shall find more difficult to repel;&mdash;under
    this impression, Sir George is disposed to promote the several
    plans you have recommended to him, relating to the general line
    of conduct you would wish to adopt in the defence of the
    important province committed to your charge. If no <a name=
    "Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>additional forces be sent out, he
    will send up the strong detachment of the 41st, composed of
    uncommonly fine young men, and in very good order: the general
    has it also in view to send you a strong detachment of the
    Newfoundland regiment, selecting their seamen and marine
    artificers, who will be most useful in the proposed works to be
    carried on at York; and here I am apprehensive that the means
    of augmenting your strength must be bounded, unless the
    Glengary Levy can be rapidly formed, and Sir George is sanguine
    in his expectations of its being speedily placed upon a
    respectable footing: in that case, it could occupy Kingston and
    that line of communication between the provinces, which you
    deem so essential to be guarded. This corps will have the very
    great advantage of starting with a better selected body of
    officers than has fallen to the lot of any Fencible regiment in
    Canada. I hope you will feel inclined to bring forward Shaw as
    one of your captains, as without your countenance I fear he
    will find it an arduous task to provide for himself and his
    brother. The uniform of the corps is to be green, like that of
    the 95th rifles.</p>

    <p>Sir George expressed himself very sensible of the policy of
    the line of conduct you would wish to pursue respecting the
    Indians; but as other considerations of the greatest political
    delicacy are so minutely interwoven with them, and as the
    American government are already inclined to view every
    transaction with those people with a jealous <a name="Page_138"
    id="Page_138"></a>and suspicious eye, he would recommend the
    utmost caution and forbearance, lest a different line of
    conduct might tend to increase the irritation between the two
    governments, which it is evidently the wish of Great Britain to
    allay.</p>

    <p>Our weather has been, and still continues for the season,
    severer than ever was recollected by the oldest stagers, and
    has rather put our Halifax friends out of conceit with the fine
    climate of Canada, particularly as Lady Prevost's health is
    delicate, and she is very sensible of cold. Mrs. Cator and Mrs.
    Baynes beg to be most kindly remembered to you. General Bowes
    accompanied Kempt to Portugal in the end of December.</p>

    <p>The American papers, under the head of English news, as late
    as the 20th January, give a circumstantial account of the death
    of Sir James Craig, on Sunday, the 12th, at his house in
    Charlotte Street. There are too many circumstances
    corroborating an event which was so greatly to be apprehended,
    to leave a shadow of doubt of the <a name="Page_139" id=
    "Page_139"></a>severe loss that all, who were favored with his
    friendship, have sustained. To me, from my earliest youth, he
    has been the best and kindest friend, a steady and powerful
    patron; for few sons ever experienced more truly paternal care
    and affectionate regard from the best of fathers, than I have
    received at the hands of that best of men. The grief that I
    cannot suppress is a selfish tribute to my own irreparable
    loss: his release from a state of cruel, lingering suffering,
    which, as I had so long witnessed, he bore with a degree of
    fortitude and patient resignation unparalleled, could have been
    no cause of regret to him, and therefore ought not to be so to
    those who most sincerely loved him; but I have so long been
    accustomed to cherish the grateful and affectionate sentiments
    of a highly favored son to the best of parents, that however I
    might have been prepared for this inevitable shock, I still
    feel that there are affections so rooted in our hearts, that
    this world's changes can never efface the impression. His
    memory will long be remembered with admiration by all who knew
    his merit. As a soldier he had few equals, and no knight had a
    fairer claim to the proud title of <i>sans peur et sans
    reproche</i>; while the widow, the orphan, and every distressed
    object that claimed his aid, will testify the generous heart
    that once animated that good and honorable man.</p>

    <p>YORK, April 8, 1812.</p>

    <p>The power which is vested in the person administering the
    government, by the amended act of the militia, passed the last
    session of the provincial parliament, of forming two flank
    companies, to be taken indiscriminately from the battalions,
    being limited to the end of the ensuing session, would almost
    deter me from incurring public expense upon a system which will
    cease to operate before its utility and efficacy can well be
    ascertained.</p>

    <p>But being anxious at this important crisis to organize an
    armed force with a view of meeting future exigencies, and to
    demonstrate by practical experience the degree of facility with
    which the militia may be trained for service, I have to request
    you to adopt immediate measures for forming and completing,
    from among such men as voluntarily offer to serve, two
    companies, not to exceed one captain, two subalterns, two
    sergeants, one drummer, and thirty-five rank and file each, in
    the regiment under your command.</p>

    <p>You will have the goodness to recommend two <a name=
    "Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>captains, whom you conceive the
    best qualified to undertake this important duty; the nominating
    of the subalterns is left to your discretion.</p>

    <p>Such other regiments as are conveniently situated to receive
    military instruction, shall have an opportunity afforded them
    of shewing their ardour in the public service, which cannot
    fail of creating a laudable emulation among the different
    corps.</p>

    <p>Assisted by your zeal, prudence, and intelligence, I
    entertain the pleasing hope of meeting with very considerable
    success, and of being able to establish the sound policy of
    rendering permanent to the end of the present war, a mode of
    military instruction little burdensome to individuals, and
    every way calculated to secure a powerful internal defence
    against hostile aggression.</p>

    <p>Printed rules and regulations, for your future guidance, are
    herewith forwarded: the most simple, and at the same time the
    most useful, movements have been selected for the practice of
    the militia.</p>

    <p>Experience has shewn the absolute necessity of adopting
    every possible precaution to preserve in a proper state the
    arms issued to the militia, and of guarding against the heavy
    defalcations which have heretofore occurred.</p>

    <p>You will make applications to the officers commanding at
    Fort Erie for the number of arms and accoutrements wanting to
    complete the men actually engaged to serve in the flank
    companies; and that officer will be instructed to comply with
    your <a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>requisition, upon
    your transmitting to him duplicate receipts, one of which is to
    be forwarded to head quarters, that you may become responsible
    for the articles delivered to your order: at the same time, the
    most liberal construction will be given to any representation
    accounting for such contingencies as are incidental to the
    service.</p>

    has served a certain time in the regiment. He is a young man
    (not yet eighteen) of an excellent disposition, educated at

    early professional abilities and attention to his duty. I shall

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, April 22, 1812.</p>

    <p>I had the honor yesterday to receive your excellency's
    letter, dated the 21st ultimo, and I entreat you to believe
    that no act within my control shall afford the government of
    the United States a legitimate pretext to add to a clamour
    which has been so artfully raised against England.</p>

    <p>We have received the account of the renewal of the embargo,
    and that the most rigorous measures have already been adopted
    to prevent the least infringement of it upon the Niagara river.
    Armed men, in coloured clothes, are continually patroling along
    the shore. These troops are stated to have recently arrived,
    but I have not been able to ascertain whether they belong to
    the new levy or to the militia. They are reported to amount to
    <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>about 300. Colonel Proctor
    has doubtless written fully on the subject, but unfortunately
    the letters, by some negligence, were left at Niagara. The
    accounts which have reached me are not therefore so
    satisfactory as could be wished. An idle boy is stated to have
    wantonly fired with ball at the guard opposite Queenstown, and
    it appears that the Americans were guilty of a similar outrage
    by firing during the night into a room in which a woman was
    sitting. Luckily no mischief followed. Being detained here upon
    civil business, I have sent Captain Glegg over to see how
    matters stand, and to arrange with both civil and military the
    best means of preventing a recurrence of a practice which may
    easily lead to serious consequences. I hope to be at Niagara
    myself the day after to-morrow.</p>

    <p>I beg leave to assure your excellency, that I receive with
    no small degree of pride the praise bestowed on my endeavours
    to improve the militia system of this province; and as the bill
    underwent some alterations after the departure of Colonel
    M'Donnell, particularly in limiting its operation to the end of
    the ensuing session, I shall have the honor to forward for your
    excellency's information the law as now enforced. I have, by
    partial and gentle means, already commenced to give it
    operation, and I make not the least doubt that a sufficient
    number will be found ready to volunteer to complete the flank
    companies; and I here beg leave to call your excellency's
    attention to the <a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>clause
    which authorizes the training of the flank companies six times
    in each month; but as no provision is made for remunerating the
    men, I presume to submit for your excellency's indulgent
    consideration, that the commissaries be instructed to issue
    rations for the number actually present at exercise. These
    companies I expect will be composed of the best description of
    inhabitants, who in most cases will have to go a great distance
    to attend parade; and, unless this liberal provision be
    allowed, will be liable to heavy expense, or be subject to
    considerable privations. According to my present arrangements,
    the number embodied will not exceed 700, and when the companies
    are completed throughout the province, they must be calculated
    at 1,800; and, as during harvest and the winter months few or
    no parades will take place, the total expense attending the
    measure can be of no material consequence in a pecuniary point
    of view, and may in a political light be productive, at this
    juncture, of considerable benefit.</p>

    <p>I have likewise to request that such portion of clothing as
    your excellency can conveniently spare from the king's stores,
    may be forwarded, to enable me to clothe such companies as are
    the most likely to be called upon duty.</p>

    <p>I am anxious to hear the real object of the embargo; should
    it be directed solely against England, the probability is that
    it leads to a war; but should France be included in its
    operation, nothing of the kind need be dreaded.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>In the expectation of
    having the honor of seeing your excellency shortly at York, I
    limit, for the present, the works of the military artificers at
    this place, to preparing a temporary magazine for the reception
    of the spare powder at Fort George and Kingston, and the
    excavation of the ditch for the proposed fortifications of the
    spot on which the government house stands.</p>

    <p>I transmit, for your excellency's perusal, a detailed
    account of the transactions which led to the unjustifiable
    censure passed by the house of assembly upon Chief Justice
    Scott. It is written by Mr. Nichol himself; and the warmth with
    which he has expressed his indignation at the wanton exercise
    of a power yet undefined, as far as regards this province, is
    not therefore surprising. I am convinced that whenever the
    business is brought legally before the judges, they will refuse
    to sanction the enormous power, under the name of privilege,
    which the house arrogates to itself. The executive will in that
    case be placed in a very awkward predicament: Mr. Nichol having
    commenced civil actions against the speaker and sergeant at
    arms for false imprisonment, will, should he succeed in
    obtaining damages, bring the question with double force on the
    <i>tapis</i>. The violence and ignorance which, in all
    probability, will mark the proceedings of the house, cannot
    fail of producing a dissolution. I apply forcibly to ministers
    for instructions, but should they be contrary to the opinion
    which the judges of the court of king's <a name="Page_148" id=
    "Page_148"></a>bench have formed of the law, I am led to
    believe they will not influence the members; therefore, one of
    two alternatives must be resorted to, either the appointment of
    more docile judges, or the decision of the question by a
    British act of parliament. I trust, for the tranquillity and
    prosperity of the province, that the latter mode may be
    preferred. I have thus freely, and perhaps with rather too much
    haste to be sufficiently explicit, stated the difficulties
    which in all likelihood I shall have to encounter at the next
    meeting of the legislature.</p>

    <p>Should the effect of the embargo appear to be directed
    solely at Great Britain, I shall avail myself of the confidence
    placed in me, and order the purchase of horses, to enable the
    car brigade to act in case of necessity. This, being a service
    which requires infinite trouble and practice to bring to any
    degree of perfection, cannot be too soon attended to.</p>

    <p>QUEBEC, April 30, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have just heard from Mr. Foster that the secretary at war,
    at Washington, has transmitted orders to Governor Tompkins, of
    New York, to send 500 of the state militia to Niagara, 500 to
    the mouth of the Black River, opposite to Kingston, and 600 to
    Champlain, in consequence of the hostile appearances in Canada.
    Mr. Foster is of opinion the government of the United States
    cal<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>culates that something
    will happen on the part of these men to produce a quarrel with
    the British troops, which may lead to retaliation on both
    sides, and occasion hostilities to commence, as in this way
    alone, it seems thought, an unjust war can be forced on the
    American people, who are represented as really averse to it. We
    must, therefore, use every effort in our power to prevent any
    collision from taking place between our forces and the
    American.</p>

    <p>I have also received information that the American garrison
    at Fort Chicago, not exceeding 60 men, has been ordered to
    Detroit, in consequence of apprehensions from the Indians.</p>

    <p>I have great satisfaction in telling you that I have
    reported the Glengary light infantry more than complete to the
    establishment of 400 rank and file, and have received Sir
    George Prevost's commands to recruit for a higher
    establishment; indeed, the quotas the officers have engaged to
    fulfil will nearly amount to double that number; and from the
    very great success that has attended our exertions, I have no
    doubt of succeeding by the end of this year. Two officers have
    divided Nova Scotia and New Brunswick for their hunting ground,
    and are permitted to recruit Acadians; and Lieutenant Ronald
    M'Donnell, of the Canadians, proceeds in a few days to Pictou
    and the <a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>highland
    settlements on the coast and gulf: he is an officer that
    appears to be eminently qualified for that service, and he is
    sanguine that the proffer of lands in the Scotch settlements of
    Upper Canada will induce great numbers to enter. I am assured
    from various channels that the men I have got are generally
    young, rather too much so, and of a good description, there
    being very few Yankees amongst them.</p>

    <p>I have long letters from my friends at home, giving me a
    detailed account of the death of my excellent and best of
    friends: the duke of York sat by his bedside for half an hour
    the day before he died, and, Somerville says, was extremely
    affected. Sir James, (Craig,) on the contrary, rallied from the
    pleasure he experienced from this condescending kindness. Sir
    James had a codicil written fair for his signature, the chief
    object of which was to add a legacy for a female cousin whom he
    did not know to be in existence, and to direct the sale of the
    priory and freehold, which cost 12,000 guineas, to enable the
    payment of the legacies: this instrument, not having been
    executed, will lead to what he most deprecated and wished to
    avoid, a lawsuit. The heirs at law will possess the freehold;
    and Wilkie, who, besides &pound;6,000, is left the two houses
    in London, furniture, &amp;c, as residuary legatee, will be
    stripped of the whole that is not given by special bequest, to
    make up the legacies: he will however, I believe, have at least
    &pound;10,000 left&mdash;very ample payment for his
    services.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>Sir George has
    announced his intention of recommending Battersby to be
    lieutenant-colonel of the Glengary corps, and ordered him to
    take the command of the recruits assembled at Three Rivers.

    <p>I have this day been honored with your excellency's
    confidential communication, dated the 30th ultimo.</p>

    <p>I have long since thought that nothing but the public voice
    restrained the United States government from commencing direct
    hostilities; and it is but reasonable to expect that they will
    seek every opportunity to influence the minds of the people
    against England, in order to bring them the more readily into
    their measures. It will be my study to guard against every
    event that can give them any just cause of complaint; but the
    proximity of the two countries will in all probability produce
    collisions which, however accidentally brought about, will be
    represented as so many acts of aggression. It would not
    surprise me if their first attempt to excite irritation were
    the seizing of the islands in the channel, to which both
    countries lay claim: such was represented to Sir James Craig on
    a former occasion to be their intention.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>In addition to the
    force specified by your excellency, I understand that six
    companies of the Ohio militia are intended for Detroit. Our
    interests with the Indians will materially suffer in
    consequence of these extensive preparations being allowed to
    proceed with impunity. I have always considered that the
    reduction of Detroit would be a signal for a cordial
    co-operation on the part of the Indians; and if we be not in
    sufficient force to effect this object, no reliance ought to be
    placed in them.</p>

    <p>About forty regulars were last week added to the garrison of
    Niagara, and by all accounts barracks are to be immediately
    constructed at Black Rock, almost opposite Fort Erie, for a
    large force.</p>

    <p>I returned three days ago from an excursion to Fort
    Erie&mdash;the Grand River, where the Indians of the Six
    Nations are settled&mdash;and back by the head of the lake.
    Every gentleman, with whom I had an opportunity of conversing,
    assured me that an exceedingly good disposition prevailed among
    the people. The flank companies, in the districts in which they
    have been established, were instantly completed with
    volunteers, and indeed an almost unanimous disposition to serve
    is daily manifested. I shall proceed to extend this system now
    I have ascertained that the people are so well
    disposed&mdash;but my means are very limited.</p>

    <p>I propose detaching 100 rank and file of the 41st regiment
    to Amherstburg, almost immediately.</p>

    <p>Sir George has allowed me to make the following extracts
    from a dispatch of Mr. Foster's, dated the 28th April, which I
    do in the minister's own words: "The American government affect
    now to have taken every step incumbent on the executive as
    preparatory to war, and leave the ultimate decision to
    congress, as vested by the constitution in that body, which is
    fluctuating as the sea: there is a great party in the house of
    representatives for war, composed principally of the western
    and southern states&mdash;members who have little to lose, and
    may gain, while the northern and eastern states are vehement
    against it. The embargo seems to have been resolved upon,
    because at the moment they did not know what else to do. The
    cabinet wished only sixty days&mdash;the senate made it ninety.
    Our government leaves no room to expect a repeal of the order
    in council, yet they wait for the return of the Hornet.
    Something decisive must then be known; perhaps when they become
    completely convinced of Bonaparte's playing upon them, it will
    end in declaring against France. The question of adjournment
    was lost, notwithstanding there was an absolute majority known
    a few minutes before in its favor. The ruling party are split
    into many; the old revolutionists, jealous of younger men
    taking a lead. The army cannot, I conceive, soon be filled
    up&mdash;they get few recruits."</p>

    <p><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>You will have heard,
    long ere you receive this, that the 49th regiment is ordered
    home; the 41st are by the same authority to return to Europe,
    but Sir George will not, under existing circumstances, attempt
    to relieve the posts in Upper Canada, so that there will be no
    immediate change in your quarter. Sir George regrets that he
    has not field officers of the description you require to
    command at Kingston and Amherstburg. The only prospect of
    relief in that respect which he has in view, is from the
    arrival of the absent inspecting field officers.</p>

    <p>The arrangement you propose respecting the unfortunate
    delinquents of the 41st regiment, will perfectly meet the
    approbation of Sir George, who approved of your not forwarding
    the resignation of the younger members, or indeed of any, if
    they are worthy of consideration.</p>

    <p>Kempt has brought his name into notice in the assault of La
    Picurina, an outwork at Badajoz, where he commanded, being on
    duty in the trenches. The Glengary levy goes on swimmingly.</p>

    <p>I was much pleased to find, by your letter of the 22d
    ultimo, you had taken precautions to prevent any act occurring
    within your control that should afford the government of the
    United States a legitimate pretext to add to the clamour
    artfully raised by it against England.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>The circumstance which
    happened to the guard stationed opposite to Queenstown, arrived
    here much exaggerated. Your account of it silenced the idle
    reports in circulation.</p>

    <p>I agree with you in deploring the limitation, until the end
    of the ensuing session, in the operation of the militia act for
    Upper Canada; but as in the event of hostilities it might not
    be possible to convene the legislature, then the bill would in
    all probability continue in force during the war, provided you
    were not induced to make an exertion for a more perfect
    law.</p>

    <p>Colonel Baynes having informed me he had an opportunity of
    communicating with you more expeditiously than by post, I
    desired him to make you acquainted with the peaceful
    intelligence I had just received from Mr. Foster; but although
    it comes with a good deal of reservation, still it warrants me
    in recommending the most rigid economy in carrying on the
    king's service, and in avoiding all expense that has not become
    absolutely necessary, as it is with the utmost difficulty money
    can be raised for the ordinary service.</p>

    <p>I am apprehensive that I cannot look forward to the pleasure
    of seeing you before the end of August, as my presence in the
    province is become indispensably necessary during the first
    operation of the new militia law.</p>

  <p>It will be assisting the reader, ere we proceed to detail the
  operations at the commencement of hostilities, to give a brief
  description, not only of the lakes and straits which constitute
  the water boundaries of Upper Canada, and of the towns and
  military posts distributed along them, as existing in the year
  1812, but also of the territory of Michigan, which was
  surrendered, with Detroit, to Major-General Brock. The distances
  are given in British statute miles.</p>

  <p>The most remote piece of water on this frontier worthy of
  notice is Lake Superior, a body of fresh water unequalled by any
  upon the face of the globe. Lake Superior is of a triangular
  form; in length 381, in breadth 161, and in circumference about
  1,150 miles. Among its islands is one nearly two-thirds as large
  as Jamaica. Out of Lake Superior a very rapid current flows, over
  immense masses of rock, along a channel of 27 miles in length,
  called St. Mary's River, into Lake Huron, at the head of which is
  the British island of St. Joseph, containing a small garrison.
  This isolated post is distant about 350 miles by water from
  Amherstburg, which contained the nearest British garrison.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>Lake Huron is in length,
  from west to east, 218 miles; in breadth, 180; and in
  circumference, through its numerous curvatures, 812 miles. Except
  the island of St. Joseph, and one or two trading establishments
  belonging to the north-west company, the shores of this lake were
  in a state of nature, or inhabited only by Indians. When the
  Americans were allowed to obtain the dominion of Lake Erie, which
  they did in 1813, it was determined at the close of the following
  year to create a naval force on Lake Huron in the ensuing season,
  (1815,) as possessing much greater security for the construction
  of vessels than Lake Erie, where the enemy could at any time
  destroy them, in the same manner as their vessels ought to have
  been previously destroyed by the British. Lake Michigan, which
  belongs wholly to the United States, is connected with Lake Huron
  at its western angle by a short and wide strait, in the centre of
  which is the island of Michilimakinack, belonging to the United
  States. This island is about 9 miles in circumference, and, like
  St. Joseph, its neighbour, it possessed a small fort and
  garrison. Lake Huron flows through the river St. Clair, which is
  in length about 60 miles, into Lake St. Clair, a small circular
  lake 30 miles in diameter. The beautiful river Thames, in Upper
  Canada, opens into Lake St. Clair, and it was along the banks of
  this river that Major-General Proctor retreated in 1813. From
  Lake St. Clair, the stream, through the Detroit, navigable for
  vessels not drawing <a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>more
  than fourteen feet water, pursues a course of nearly 40 miles
  into Lake Erie.</p>

  <p>Upon the western side of the Detroit is situate the American
  town of that name. About 5 miles below Detroit, upon the opposite
  side of the strait, is the British village of Sandwich, then
  containing scarcely fifty houses; and 18 miles lower, and within
  four of the termination of the strait, is the British village of
  Amherstburg, then containing about one hundred houses, and a fort
  where a small garrison was maintained, and where the principal
  vessels for the service of Lake Erie were constructed. The
  American village of Brownstown stands nearly opposite to
  Amherstburg, which is distant from Quebec by the nearest route by
  water 815 miles, from Fort Erie about 250 miles, and from York
  315 miles.</p>

  <p>Lake Erie, from Miamis Bay to the entrance of the straits of
  Niagara, is in length 257 miles, in breadth 64 miles, and in
  circumference 658 miles. The greatest depth of water is between
  forty and forty-five fathoms, but a very rocky bottom renders the
  anchorage unsafe in blowing weather. Except Amherstburg, the
  British have no harbour or naval dep&ocirc;t upon Lake Erie,
  while the Americans have two or three excellent ones.
  <i>Presqu'&icirc;le</i> harbour is situate on the southern side
  of the lake, not far from the entrance to the Niagara. It is a
  safe station, but has a seven feet bar at its entrance, as indeed
  have all the other harbours on this lake. The town, named Erie,
  is situate on the south side <a name="Page_159" id=
  "Page_159"></a>of the harbour, and contains a dock yard, in which
  the Americans built their Lake Erie fleet. To the eastward of the
  town stands a strong battery, and on the point of the Peninsula
  forming the harbour, a block house, for the protection of this
  naval dep&ocirc;t. The rivers Raisin, Sandusky, and Miami, the
  scenes of important operations during the war, discharge
  themselves into Lake Erie.</p>

  <p>On the north-western side of the entrance to the Niagara river
  stands, at a distance of 565 miles from Quebec, the British fort
  Erie, at best a very inconsiderable work. Near to the same outlet
  from Lake Erie is Buffalo Creek, on the border of which is built
  the American village of Buffalo; and about 2 miles beyond it,
  Black Rock, where there is a battery, and a ferry, about 800
  yards across, to Bertie, in Upper Canada. The Niagara proceeds at
  a quick rate past several small and one large island, called
  <i>Grande Isle</i>, 10 miles long; about 2 miles below which, on
  the American side, and distant 2 miles from the Falls, is the
  site of Fort Schlosser. At about the same distance from the
  Falls, on the opposite side, standing on the northern bank of the
  river Chippewa, is the British village of the same name, distant
  from Fort Erie 17 miles. Chippewa consisted chiefly of store
  houses; and near it was a small stockaded work, called Fort
  Chippewa. At the distance of 23 miles from the entrance to the
  Niagara, is Goat Island, about half a mile long, and which
  extends to the precipice that gives rise to the celebrated
  <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>Falls. The larger body of
  water flows between Upper Canada and Goat Island, at the upper
  end of which island the broken water, or <i>rapids</i>, commence.
  Here the stream passes on both sides of the island, over a bed of
  rocks and precipices, with astonishing rapidity; till, having
  descended more than fifty feet in the distance of half a mile, it
  falls, on the British side 157, and on the New York side 162,
  feet perpendicularly.</p>

  <p>From the cataract, the river is a continued rapid, half a mile
  in width, for about 7 miles. At this point stand, opposite to
  each other, the villages of Queenstown and Lewistown. The latter,
  situate upon the American side, contained, till destroyed as a
  retaliatory measure, between forty and fifty houses. At about six
  miles and a half from Queenstown, near to the river side, stands
  Fort George, then constructed of earthen ramparts and palisades
  of cedar, and mounting no heavier metal than 9-pounders. About
  half a mile below Fort George, and close to the borders of Lake
  Ontario, stood the beautiful and flourishing village of Newark,
  which was burnt by the Americans.</p>

  <p>Directly opposite to Newark, upon a neck of land projecting
  partly across the mouth of the river, which is here 875 yards in
  width, stands the American fort of Niagara, the scene of so many
  conflicts. It was built by the French in 1751; taken by us in
  1759;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and, along with
  <a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>several other frontier
  posts, ceded to the United States in 1794; and, though since
  taken, has again been ceded to the same power. Fort Niagara,
  unlike any of the Canadian forts along that frontier, is a
  regular fortification, built of stone, on the land side, with
  breast works, and every necessary appendage. It mounts between
  twenty and thirty heavy pieces of ordnance, and contains a
  furnace for heating shot.</p>

  <p>The strait of Niagara is about 36 miles in length; and its
  shores, on both sides, were, more or less, the scenes of active
  warfare during the whole period of hostilities. Lake Ontario, to
  which the strait leads, is in length, from west to east, 171, in
  breadth 50, and in circumference 467 miles. The depth of water
  varies much, it being in some places three or four, in others
  fifty fathoms: towards the centre three hundred fathoms of line
  have, it is said, not found the bottom. York harbour lies on the
  north side of Lake Ontario; is nearly circular, of about a mile
  and a half in diameter, and formed by a narrow peninsula
  extending to Gibraltar Point, upon which a blockhouse has been
  erected. The town of York, (now called Toronto,) the infant
  capital of Upper Canada, is in lat. 43&deg; 35' north, and long.
  78&deg; 30' west, and is distant from Fort George by water about
  30 miles. The public buildings consisted of a government house,
  the house of assembly, a church, court-house, and a gaol, with
  numerous stores belonging to government. <a name="Page_162" id=
  "Page_162"></a>Kingston harbour is situate at the eastern
  extremity of Lake Ontario. It contains good anchorage in three
  fathoms water, and was defended by a small battery of 9-pounders
  on Mississaga Point, and another, of the same metal chiefly, on
  Point Frederick. The town, which was the largest and most
  populous in the Upper Province, contained about 370 houses;
  including several buildings and stores belonging to government.
  Its distance from York is 145, from Montreal, in an opposite
  direction, 198, and from Quebec 378 miles. Opposite to, and
  distant about half a mile from, the town, is a long low
  peninsula, forming the west side of Navy Bay, the principal naval
  dep&ocirc;t of the British on this lake, and where the ships of
  war were constructed.</p>

  <p>Of the American military posts on Lake Ontario, the principal
  one is Sackett's harbour, distant from Kingston, by the ship
  channel, 35 miles. The harbour is small but well sheltered. From
  the north-west runs out a low point of land, upon which was the
  dock yard with large store houses, and all the buildings
  requisite for such an establishment. Upon this point there was a
  strong work called Fort Tompkins, having within it a blockhouse
  two stories high: on the land side it was covered by a strong
  picketing, in which there were embrasures; at the bottom of the
  harbour was the village, containing about seventy houses; and, to
  the southward of it, a large barrack, capable of containing 2,000
  men, and generally occu<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>pied
  by the marines belonging to the fleet. Towards the middle of
  1814, there were three additional works, Fort Virginia, Fort
  Chauncey, and Fort Kentucky, as well as several new blockhouses;
  and the guns then mounted upon the different forts exceeded
  sixty.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

  <p>The greatest length of the Michigan territory, from south-east
  to north-west, is 500 miles, and the number of square miles both
  of land and water is estimated at 150,000. The country was then
  chiefly in the possession of the Indians, and the white
  population amounted by the previous census to about 5,000. It
  includes two peninsulas of unequal size, in addition to which are
  numerous islands, constituent parts of the territory. The most
  important of these is Michilimakinack, already described. This
  island, while in the former possession of the British, was the
  general rendezvous of the North-West traders and the Indians they
  supplied. Here the outfits were furnished for the countries of
  Lake Michigan and the Mississippi, Lake Superior and the
  North-West; and here the returns of furs were collected and
  embarked for Montreal. Detroit, the chief town of the territory,
  is situated on the right bank of the strait, 10 miles below Lake
  St. Clair and 28 miles above Lake Erie. It then contained above
  two hundred houses, many of brick, and upwards of 1,200
  inhabitants. In the rear of the fort was an <a name="Page_164"
  id="Page_164"></a>extensive common, skirted by boundless and
  almost impenetrable forests. We learn from Morse's American
  Geography, on the acknowledged authority of Governor Hull, that
  Fort Detroit, in 1810, was a regular work of an oblong figure,
  "covering about an acre of ground. The parapets were about twenty
  feet in height, built of earth and sods, with four bastions, the
  whole surrounded with pallisadoes, a deep ditch, and glacis. It
  stood immediately back of the town, and had strength to withstand
  a regular siege, but did not command the river." And as the
  American government had been for some time secretly preparing for
  war, it may be safely inferred, that in the meanwhile this fort
  had been rather strengthened than permitted to fall to decay; and
  that it was at least as tenable in 1812 as when Governor Hull,
  two years before, gave the preceding description of its defences.
  The town of Detroit is in lat. 42&deg; 15' north, and long.
  82&deg; 33' west.</p>

  <p>About the year 1763, Detroit, then indeed the far west, and
  containing a garrison of 300 men, was nearly captured by
  stratagem by Pontiac, the celebrated Indian chief of that day,
  who waged war against the British, and whose alliance, before the
  capture of Quebec by Wolfe, in 1759, was anxiously courted by
  both the French and English.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id=

  <p>The discussions which had been so long pending between Great
  Britain and the United States, assumed, during the winter of
  1811-12, a very serious aspect. But many did not believe that the
  latter power was inclined to proceed to extremities; while
  others, who foresaw that it only awaited a favorable moment to
  invade the Canadas, which were supposed ripe for revolt and would
  therefore fall an easy conquest, were prepared to expect what
  soon after followed, a declaration of war against Great
  Britain.</p>

  <p>As this was not the first time that the American government
  had proceeded to menaces, and as the northern and eastern states
  were known to be averse to hostilities, the British ministry were
  deluded into a belief that peace would yet be maintained. Mr.
  Foster, the English minister at Washington, seems to have
  partaken of this delusion, for it does not appear that he had
  taken any precautionary measures to convey to the governor of the
  British North American Provinces the earliest intelligence of the
  declaration of war on the 18th June, 1812; and, had it not been
  for the prudent foresight of some British merchants at <a name=
  "Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>New York, it is possible that the
  first intimation would have been received from the mouths of the
  American cannon. To Upper Canada Mr. Foster sent no notice
  whatever of the war, and Major-General Brock was left to learn it
  officially through the circuitous and dilatory channel of the
  governor-general. Happily, individual diligence made up for this
  unpardonable neglect; and the war was known by private expresses
  at Montreal, in Lower, and at Fort George, in Upper Canada, on
  the 24th of June, or in six days after its declaration at
  Washington.</p>

  <p>At this period the exigencies of the Peninsular war, which
  depended chiefly upon English arms and English money, required
  the almost undivided attention and energies of the British
  ministry, who are thus entitled to some excuse for their neglect
  of North American affairs; but they will still remain amenable to
  the charge of having been guilty of the folly of too much
  despising the new enemy arrayed against them at that most busy
  and critical moment. The want of a sufficient force for the
  protection of the Canadas<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id=
  "FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class=
  "fnanchor">[54]</a> might have proved fatal, at least to the
  Upper Province, had not Major-General Brock, from the first
  moment of being placed at the head of his government, <a name=
  "Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>been convinced that war was
  inevitable; and that in consequence every exertion should be used
  to place the province in as respectable a state of defence as his
  very limited means would admit. The instant the navigation opened
  in the spring, a supply of ordnance and other stores was hurried
  up to fort St. Joseph; and its commandant, Captain Roberts, was
  instructed to be constantly on his guard. Similar precautions
  were adopted relative to Amherstburg, to which post Major-General
  Brock paid a visit early in June, and fortunately took with him a
  reinforcement of 100 men of the 41st regiment. But in the
  execution of his plans he had to encounter many obstacles, among
  which the subordinate nature of his command was not the least
  formidable. Even as late as the 27th May, Sir George Prevost does
  not seem to have considered hostilities so near, as on that day
  he recommended to Major-General Brock the most rigid economy in
  carrying on the public service, and in avoiding all expense that
  was not absolutely necessary, on the plea of the great difficulty
  of raising money. Sir George has, however, been wrongly accused
  of not sending any instructions whatever to Major-General Brock
  for some weeks after he received intimation of the war, as he did
  so from Montreal on the 7th and 10th of July, or in less than a
  fortnight afterwards; but, either from his dispatches not being
  transmitted by express, or from some other unexplained cause,
  they did not reach their destination until the 29th of July, or
  <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>exactly five weeks after the
  declaration of war was known in Upper Canada.</p>

  <p>On the breaking out of hostilities, the regular force in Upper
  Canada amounted to barely 1,500 men, including seamen, as
  under:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">41st Regiment&nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 900</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">10th Veterans&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; 250</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Newfoundland Regiment&nbsp;
  250</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Royal Artillery&nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 50</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Provincial Seamen&nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; 50</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">====</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 9em;">Total 1500 men.</span><br /></p>

  <p>This force had to occupy the forts St. Joseph, Amherstburg,
  and Chippewa&mdash;Fort Erie and Fort George&mdash;and York and
  Kingston&mdash;to maintain the superiority on the lakes; to
  preserve the communication and escort convoys between Coteau de
  Lac and Kingston; and to defend an assailable frontier of nearly
  800 miles, reckoning from the confines of Lower Canada to
  Amherstburg, and excluding the British coast from the Detroit to
  Fort St. Joseph. With this very inadequate force, it was the
  opinion of the highest authorities that the country could not be
  maintained. Major-General Brock was well aware that, in carrying
  on the war along so extensive a frontier, uncovered by a single
  fortress of strength, and with such a handful of regular troops,
  he could only expect success in the aid and zealous co-operation
  of the people. But the province had long been torn by intestine
  disputes, and the prevailing faction<a name="Page_169" id=
  "Page_169"></a>which had been originally established by one of
  the judges, and which after his departure was fostered by one of
  his zealous supporters&mdash;had been for years hostile to the
  measures of the government. We have already given Major-General
  Brock's speech to the provincial parliament, on his meeting it
  for the first time; the session, although obstructed by party
  dissensions and unlooked-for opposition, terminated better than
  was anticipated, as the rancorous spirit of many was subdued by
  his frank and conciliatory demeanour; and laws were passed which
  enabled him to organize the flank companies of the militia,
  unaccompanied, however, by the desired oath of abjuration, so as
  to exclude settlers from the United States and persons of
  doubtful loyalty. A troop of volunteer cavalry was also
  incorporated, and on his return to York from Amherstburg, about
  the 20th of June, Major-General Brock was gratified by the offer
  of a company of farmers' sons with their draft horses for the
  equipment of a car brigade, under Captain Holcroft, of the royal
  artillery, which offer he gladly accepted.</p>

  <p>Major-General Brock was at York when he received intelligence
  of the war&mdash;an event which he had long anticipated, and
  which therefore did not take him by surprise. After assembling
  his council and summoning an extra session of the legislature, he
  hastened with his brigade major, Evans, and his aide-de-camp,
  Captain Glegg, to Fort George, on the Niagara frontier, where he
  <a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>immediately established his
  head quarters. It was at first his intention to capture the
  opposite American fort Niagara; but the high responsibility he
  was about to assume, of acting without instructions or an
  official communication, being represented to him, he confined
  himself to collecting and preparing his small force for offensive
  or defensive operations. Early in July he procured a "National
  Intelligencer," which contained the act of congress declaratory
  of war, and the message of the president accompanying it, and
  this information was of course decisive.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, June 25, 1812.</p>

    <p>Sir George Prevost desires me to inform you that he has this
    instant received intelligence from Mr. Richardson, by an
    express to the north-west company, announcing that the American
    government had declared war against Great Britain. This
    dispatch left New York on the 20th instant, and does not
    furnish any other circumstance of intelligence whatever. His
    excellency is induced to give perfect and entire credit to this
    report, although it has not yet reached through any official
    channel. Indeed, the extraordinary dispatch which has attended

    every efficient support in his power.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, July 3, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have been anxiously expecting for some days to receive the
    honor of your excellency's commands in regard to the measures
    the most proper to be pursued on the present emergency.</p>

    <p>The accounts received, first through a mercantile channel,
    and soon after repeated from various quarters, of war having
    been declared by the United States against Great Britain, would
    have <a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>justified, in my
    opinion, offensive operations. But the reflection that at
    Detroit and Michilimakinack the weak state of the garrisons
    would prevent the commanders from accomplishing any essential
    service, connected in any degree with their future security,
    and that my means of annoyance on this communication were
    limited to the reduction of Fort Niagara, which could easily be
    battered at any future period, I relinquished my original
    intention, and attended only to defensive measures. My first
    object has been the calling out of the flank companies of
    militia, which has produced a force on this line of about 800
    men. They turned out very cheerfully, but already shew a spirit
    of impatience. The king's stores are now at so low an ebb, that
    they scarcely furnish any article of use or comfort. Blankets,
    hammocks and kettles, are all to be purchased; and the troops,
    when watching the banks of the river, stand in the utmost need
    of tents. Mr. Couche has adopted the most efficacious means to
    pay the militia in paper currency. I cannot positively state
    the number of militia that will be embodied, but they cannot
    exceed throughout the province 4,000 men.</p>

    <p>The Americans are very active on the opposite side, in the
    erection of redoubts; we are not idle on our part, but
    unfortunately, having supplied Amherstburg with the guns which
    that post required from Fort George, depending upon getting
    others from Kingston to supply their place, we <a name=
    "Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>find ourselves at this moment
    rather short of that essential arm. I have, however, every
    reason to think that they are embarked on board the Earl Moira,
    which vessel, according to Major M'Pherson's report, was to
    have sailed on the 28th ultimo. The Americans have, I believe,
    about 1,200 regulars and militia between Fort Niagara and Black
    Rock, and I consider myself at this moment perfectly safe
    against any attempt they can make. About 100 Indians from the
    Grand River have attended to my summons; the remainder promise
    to come also, but I have too much reason to conclude that the
    Americans have been too successful in their endeavours to sow
    dissension and disaffection among them. It is a great object to
    get this fickle race interspersed among the troops. I should be
    unwilling, in the event of a retreat, to have three or four
    hundred of them hanging on my flank. I shall probably have to
    sacrifice some money to gain them over, and the appointment of
    a few officers with salaries will be absolutely necessary.</p>

    <p>The Americans make a daily parade of their force, and easily
    impose on the people on this side in regard to their numbers. I
    do not think they exceed 1,200, but they are represented as
    infinitely more numerous.</p>

    <p>For the last fortnight every precaution has been taken to
    guard against the least communication, and to this day we are
    ignorant whether the president has sanctioned the war
    resolutions of the two <a name="Page_174" id=
    "Page_174"></a>houses of congress; that is, whether war be
    actually declared.</p>

    <p>The car brigade has been completed for service with horses
    belonging to gentlemen, who spared them free of expense.</p>

    <p>I have not been honored with a line from Mr. Foster, nor
    with all my endeavours have I been able to obtain information
    of any consequence. The Prince Regent made her first voyage
    this morning, and I purpose sending her to Kingston this
    evening, to bring such articles as are absolutely necessary,
    which we know have arrived from Quebec. I trust she will
    out-sail the Oneida brig.</p>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, July 4, 1812.</p>

    <p>We have a report here of your having commenced operations by
    levelling the American fort at Niagara. The general is most
    anxious to hear good and recent intelligence from your quarter.
    There is no considerable assembly of troops in our
    neighbourhood as yet; the flank companies, embodied under
    Colonel Young, are on their march, and the 2,000 militia will
    form a chain of posts from St. John's to La Prairie. The town
    militia of this and Quebec, to the amount of 3,000 in each
    city, have volunteered being embodied and drilled, and will
    take their proportion of garrison duty to relieve the troops.
    The proclamation for declaring martial law is prepared, and
    will be <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>speedily issued.
    All aliens will be required to take the oath of allegiance, or
    immediately quit the province. Our cash is at its last issue,
    and a substitute of paper must per force be resorted to. This
    has been Sir George's principal object in calling the
    legislature together. You have a very arduous and difficult
    card to play, and have our sincere and confident wishes for
    your success. Sir George strongly recommends extreme moderation
    in the use of the Indians, and to keep them in control as much
    as possible.</p>
  </div>

  <p>[This letter contains the details of a large and armed
  assembly at La Chine, near Montreal, of French Canadians, who
  refused to serve in the embodied militia. They were dispersed by
  the light company of the 49th, and a detachment of artillery with
  two field pieces, under the command of Major Plenderleath, of the
  49th, but not before one Canadian was killed and another
  dangerously wounded.]</p>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, July 7, 1812.</p>

    <p>It was only on my arrival at Montreal that I received Mr.
    Foster's notification of the congress of the United States
    having declared war against Great Britain; the fact had been
    previously ascertained through mercantile channels.</p>

    <p>I am convinced you have acted wisely in abstaining from
    offensive operations, which in their effect might have united a
    people governed by public opinion, and among whom too much
    division exists, at this moment, to admit of its influence in
    promoting vigorous measures against us.</p>

    <p>The manner of the flank companies of militia turning out
    must have been very satisfactory to <a name="Page_176" id=
    "Page_176"></a>you. I hope your supplies of ordnance and
    ordnance stores, on their way from Kingston, have arrived
    safe.</p>

    <p>I have caused arms, accoutrements and ammunition, to be
    forwarded for the use of the Cornwall, Stormont, and Dundas
    battalions of militia. Camp equipage for 500 men shall be sent
    to you as soon as possible, together with muskets.</p>

    <p>We are on the eve of substituting paper for bullion. I am
    aware of the Canadian prejudice against such a circulating
    medium, but it must give way to the imperious necessity of the
    times.</p>

    <p>It is highly proper you should secure the services of the
    Indians; but restrain and control them as much as you can.
    Whatever appointments you deem indispensably necessary you are
    authorized to make, as well as the sacrifice of some money to
    gain them over. It is proper we should maintain our ascendancy
    over the Indians, and feed with proper food their predeliction
    for us.</p>

    <p>Colonel Lethbridge, an inspecting field officer, is under
    orders for Kingston, and there to wait your commands.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, July 8, 1812.</p>

    <p>I was highly gratified yesterday in receiving your letters
    of the 3d July, for we have felt extremely anxious about you
    ever since we have learnt the unexpected declaration of war,
    which had been so long threatened that no one believed <a name=
    "Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>it would ever seriously take
    place; and even now it is the prevailing opinion that, from the
    opposition testified by the eastern states, offensive measures
    are not likely to be speedily adopted against this country. Sir
    George is inclined to let these sentiments take their course,
    and as little advantage would accrue by more active measures on
    our part, our present plans are all defensive. General de
    Rottenburg is arrived, and the flank companies embodied are on
    their way: this corps, with the embodied militia, will form a
    chain from La Prairie to St. John's, with a light corps
    advanced in their front. We have reports of the 103d regiment
    being in the river, and, it is added, recruits for the 100th
    regiment.</p>

    <p>Sir George has had applications from so many quarters for
    militia below Kingston, that to insure a general arrangement
    and to adopt the best system that circumstances will admit, he
    has directed Colonel Lethbridge, the inspecting field officer
    here, to proceed through the line of settlements to see the
    several colonels and corps of militia so as to fix their
    quotas, and afterwards to proceed to Kingston and assume the
    command of that post, if necessary: he will be placed under
    your orders, but you will perhaps not wish to bring him in
    contact with the 41st regiment, as he is senior to Colonel
    Proctor.</p>

    <p>Sir George desires me to say, that he does not attempt to
    prescribe specific rules for your guidance&mdash;they must be
    directed by your discretion <a name="Page_178" id=
    "Page_178"></a>and the circumstances of the time: the present
    order of the day with him is forbearance, until hostilities are
    more decidedly marked.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, July 10, 1812.</p>

    <p>Colonel Lethbridge's departure for Kingston affords me an
    opportunity of replying more fully and confidentially to your
    letter of the 3d instant, than I could venture to have done the
    day before, yesterday by an uncertain conveyance. That officer
    has been desired to transmit to you, together with this
    dispatch, a copy of the instructions given to him for his
    guidance until the exigencies of the service make it necessary
    in your estimation to substitute others, or to employ the
    colonel in any other situation of command. In them you will
    find expressed my sentiments respecting the mode of conducting
    the war on our part, suited to the existing circumstances; and
    as they change, so must we vary our line of conduct, adapting
    it to our means of preserving entire the king's provinces.</p>

    <p>Our numbers would not justify offensive operations being
    undertaken, unless they were solely calculated to strengthen a
    defensive attitude. I consider it prudent and politic to avoid
    any measure which can in its effect have a tendency to unite
    the people in the American States. Whilst disunion prevails
    among them, their attempts on these provinces will be feeble;
    it is, therefore, our <a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>duty
    carefully to avoid committing any act which may, even by
    construction, tend to unite the eastern and southern states,
    unless, by its perpetration, we are to derive a considerable
    and important advantage. But the government of the United
    States, resting on public opinion for all its measures, is
    liable to sudden and violent changes; it becomes an essential
    part of our duty to watch the effect of parties on its
    measures, and to adapt ours to the impulse given by those
    possessed of influence over the public mind in America.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding these observations, I have to assure you of
    my perfect confidence in your measures for the preservation of
    Upper Canada. All your wants shall be supplied as fast as
    possible, except money, of which I have so little, as to be
    obliged to have recourse to a paper currency.</p>

    <p>The adjutant-general has reported to you the aid we have
    afforded, in arms and ammunition, to your militia at Cornwall,
    Glengary, Dundas, and Stormont.</p>

    <p>To prevent an interruption to the communication between the
    two provinces, it is fit a system of convoy should be
    established between Montreal and Kingston; and as Major-General
    de Rottenburg is to remain here in command of a cordon of
    troops, consisting of regulars and militia, (established in
    this neighbourhood to prevent an irruption for the plunder of
    Montreal,) whilst I attend to parliamentary duties at Quebec,
    on that subject you may communicate direct with the
    major-<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>general, as he has
    my instructions to co-operate with you on preserving this
    important object.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, July 12, 1812.</p>

    <p>With the exception of occasional firing from the opposite
    shore, (the unauthorized act of an undisciplined militia,)
    nothing of a hostile nature has occurred on this communication
    since I last had the honor of addressing your excellency.</p>

    <p>The enemy is busy constructing batteries at different points
    in the river, but he does not appear to have yet received
    cannon to place in them. We are doing all we can on this side
    to counteract his views, and the arrival this morning of the
    Royal George and the vessels under her convoy, bringing various
    pieces of ordnance, will give us in this respect a decided
    superiority.</p>

    <p>The militia, which assembled here immediately on the account
    being received of war being declared by the United States, have
    been improving daily in discipline; but the men evince a degree
    of impatience under their present restraint, that is far from
    inspiring confidence. So great was the clamour to return and
    attend to their farms, that I found myself in some measure
    compelled to sanction the departure of a large proportion; and
    I am not without my apprehensions that the remainder will, in
    defiance of the law, which can only impose a fine of &pound;20,
    leave the service the moment the harvest commences. There can
    be no doubt that <a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>a large
    portion of the population in this neighbourhood are sincere in
    their professions to defend the country; but it appears
    likewise evident to me that the greater part are either
    indifferent to what is passing, or so completely American as to
    rejoice in the prospect of a change of government. Many who now
    consider our means inadequate, would readily take an active
    part were the regular troops increased. These cool calculators
    are numerous in all societies.</p>

    <p>The alacrity and good temper with which the militia, in the
    first instance, marched to the frontiers, have tended to infuse
    in the mind of the enemy a very different sentiment of the
    disposition of the inhabitants, who, he was led to believe
    would, upon the first summons, declare themselves an American
    state. The display for several days of a large force was made,
    I have every reason to believe, in that expectation.</p>

    <p>Nearly the whole of the arms at my disposal have been
    issued. They are barely sufficient to arm the militia
    immediately required to guard the frontier. Were I furnished
    with the means of distributing arms among the people, in whom
    confidence can be placed, they would not only overawe the
    disaffected, but prove of essential use in the event of
    invasion. The militia assembled in a wretched state in regard
    to clothing; many were without shoes, an article which can
    scarcely be provided in the country.</p>

    <p>After the cannon, which have arrived this morn<a name=
    "Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>ing, are mounted, I shall consider
    my front perfectly secure. I do not imagine the enemy will
    hazard a water excursion with a view to turn my flanks. He
    probably will wait until winter, when the ice will enable him
    to cross with the utmost facility to any part between Fort Erie
    and as far as Long Point. My situation will then depend upon
    the force the enemy may bring to invade the province. Should
    the troops have to move, the want of tents will be severely
    felt.</p>

    <p>A person who left Sandwich yesterday week, pretends that the
    enemy was then in the act of cannonading the place. I have not
    heard from Lieut.-Colonel St. George since my last letter to
    your excellency.</p>

    <p>An officer is so absolutely necessary to command in the
    eastern district, that I have consented to Major-General Shaw
    proceeding thither in that capacity. I have full confidence in
    his judgment, and his conduct in the field is undoubted. He of
    course will assume the command in virtue of his militia rank,
    and will be liable to be superseded by any lieutenant-colonel
    your excellency may be pleased to appoint.</p>

    <p>The expense of defending this province will unquestionably
    be great; upon a rough calculation, and supposing that 4,000
    militia be constantly embodied, it cannot be estimated at less
    than &pound;140,000 per annum. However great the sum, it will
    be applied to very considerable advantage, provided your
    excellency be enabled to send rein<a name="Page_183" id=
    "Page_183"></a>forcements, as without them it is scarcely
    possible that the government of the United States will be so
    inactive or supine as to permit the present limited force to
    remain in possession of the country. Whatever can be done to
    preserve it, or to delay its fall, your excellency may rest
    assured will be exerted.</p>

    <p>Having been suddenly called away from York, I had not time
    to close my dispatch, giving your excellency an account of my
    proceedings during my stay at Amherstburg. I now have the honor
    to forward two documents, detailing the steps taken by the
    Indian department to prevail on that unfortunate people to
    accommodate their differences with the American government.</p>

  <p><i>Extract from an American Newspaper</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>BUFFALO, July 14, 1812.</p>

    <p>Major-General Brock is at present at Newark, superintending
    the various defences on the river. He is stated to be an able
    and experienced officer, with undoubted courage. He came from
    Little York soon after hearing the declaration of war, and, it
    was believed, with a serious intention of attacking Fort
    Niagara, but, contrary to what has been reported, he made no
    demand of a surrender.</p>

    <p>Expecting a descent from the American army, the Canadians
    have, for ten days past, been removing their families and
    effects from the river into the interior. At Newark, Queenston,
    and other villages on the river, there are no inhabitants
    <a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>except a few civilians and
    officers and soldiers. It is even said, that an immense
    quantity of specie, plate, &amp;c, from various parts of the
    province, have been boxed up, and destined for Quebec.</p>

    <p>The British are understood to have about six or seven
    hundred regular troops stationed between the lakes, from Fort
    George to Fort Erie. These men are generally those who have
    "seen service" in various parts of the world. The militia of
    the province are ordered out <i>en masse</i>.</p>

    <p>It is stated by gentlemen of intelligence at Lewistown, that
    the government of Canada have in their employment, under pay,
    about 250 Indians, armed complete: a part of them are
    mounted.</p>

    <p>Brigadier-General William Wadsworth, from Genesee, commands
    the troops on our frontiers. His aids are Major Adam Hoops and
    Major W. H. Spencer. His head quarters are now at Lewistown. It
    is impossible to state the precise number of troops under his
    command, because the militia ordered on the lines are
    returning, and the companies composing the regiments under his
    command have not all arrived; but from what we learn, there are
    in regular troops, volunteers, and detached militia, above
    4,000 stationed at Rock, Lewistown, Youngstown, and Fort
    Niagara. The troops are in excellent health, in good spirits,
    and well supplied. They appear quite impatient for want of
    employment. There has been some firing from the sentries on
    both sides of the river.</p>

  <p>The American government, in anticipation of its declaration of
  war, had detached from the state of Ohio to the Michigan
  territory an army of about 2,500 men, under the command of
  Brigadier-General Hull, who, said President Madison in his
  message to congress, "possessing discretionary authority to act
  offensively, passed into Canada with a prospect of easy and
  victorious progress." The enemy evidently confided in the very
  limited defensive means of the Upper Province, and in the
  impossibility of its receiving early assistance from the mother
  country. They relied also on the supposed disaffection of many of
  its inhabitants, and they expected confidently that, weak and
  divided, it would fall an easy prey to the invaders; but they
  were soon undeceived. Having crossed over to the Canadian village
  of Sandwich on the 12th July, Brigadier-General Hull issued on
  that day the following insidious but able proclamation, which was
  doubtless written at Washington. It will be seen that the
  American general was made to say, that he did not ask the
  assistance of the Canadians, as he had no doubt of <a name=
  "Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>eventual success, because he came
  prepared for every contingency with a force which would look down
  all opposition, and that that force was but the vanguard of a
  much greater!</p>

    <p>Inhabitants of Canada!&mdash;After thirty years of peace and

    resistance or unconditional submission.</p>

    <p>The army under my command has invaded your country, and the

    seen her injustice&mdash;but I do not ask you to avenge the one
    or redress the other. The United States are sufficiently
    powerful to afford you every security, consistent with their
    rights and your expectations. I tender you the invaluable
    blessings of civil, political, and religious liberty, and their
    necessary result, individual and general prosperity&mdash;that
    liberty which gave decision to our councils and energy to our
    conduct in our struggle for independence, and which conducted
    us safely and triumphantly through the stormy period of the
    revolution&mdash;that liberty which has raised us to an
    elevated rank among the nations of the world, and which has
    afforded us a greater measure of peace and security, of wealth
    and improvement, than ever yet fell to the lot of any
    people.</p>

    <p>In the name of my country, and by the authority of my
    government, I promise protection to your persons, pro<a name=
    "Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>perty and rights. Remain at your
    homes&mdash;pursue your peaceful and customary
    avocations&mdash;raise not your hands against your brethren.
    Many of your fathers fought for the freedom and independence we
    now enjoy. Being children, therefore, of the same family with
    us, and heirs to the same heritage, the arrival of an army of
    friends must be hailed by you with a cordial welcome. You will
    be emancipated from tyranny and oppression, and restored to the
    dignified station of freemen.</p>

    <p>Had I any doubt of eventual success, I might ask your
    assistance; but I do not. I come prepared for every
    contingency. I have a force which will look down all
    opposition, and that force is but the vanguard of a much
    greater. If, contrary to your own interests and the just
    expectation of my country, you should take part in the
    approaching contest, you will be considered and treated as
    enemies, and the horrors and calamities of war will stalk
    before you. If the barbarous and savage policy of Great Britain
    be pursued, and the savages be let loose to murder our
    citizens, and butcher our women and children, this war will be
    a war of extermination. The first stroke of the tomahawk, the
    first attempt with the scalping knife, will be the signal of
    one indiscriminate scene of desolation. No white man, found
    fighting by the side of an Indian, will be taken
    prisoner&mdash;instant destruction will be his lot. If the
    dictates of reason, duty, justice, and humanity, cannot prevent
    the employment of a force which respects no rights and knows no
    wrong, it will be prevented by a severe and relentless system
    of retaliation.</p>

    <p>I doubt not your courage and firmness&mdash;I will not doubt
    your attachment to liberty. If you tender your services
    voluntarily, they will be accepted readily. The United States
    offer you peace, liberty, and security. Your choice lies
    between these and war, slavery and destruction. Choose, then,
    but choose wisely; and may He who knows the justice of our
    cause, and who holds in <a name="Page_188" id=
    "Page_188"></a>his hand the fate of nations, guide you to a
    result the most compatible with your rights and interests, your
    peace and prosperity.</p>

  <p>The following counter-proclamation was published by
  Major-General Brock, "a proclamation as remarkable for the solid
  reasoning and dignity of its language, as that of the American
  for its presumption."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id=
  "FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class=
  "fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of
    America against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
    Ireland, and its dependencies, has been followed by the actual
    invasion of this province, in a remote frontier of the western
    district, by a detachment of the armed force of the United
    States.</p>

    <p>The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to
    invite his majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and
    unresisting submission, but insults them with a cell to seek
    voluntarily the protection of his government.</p>

    <p>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets
    bestowed in this appeal of the American commander to the people
    of Upper Canada, on the administration of his majesty, every
    inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation
    of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular
    circumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly
    affirm to himself that he has been injured by the government,
    in his person, his property, or his liberty? Where is to be
    found, in any part of the world, a growth so rapid in
    prosperity and wealth, as this colony exhibits? Settled, not
    thirty years, by a <a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>band of
    veterans, exiled from their former possessions on account of
    their loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people is to be
    found, who, under the fostering liberality of their sovereign,
    has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to
    what were possessed by their ancestors.</p>

    <p>This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by
    the utmost liberality of the government, or the persevering
    industry of the people, had not the maritime power of the
    mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every
    market, where the produce of their labour was in request.</p>

    <p>The unavoidable and immediate consequences of a separation
    from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable
    advantage; and what is offered you in exchange? To become a
    territory of the United States, and share with them that
    exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their government
    enforces; you are not even flattered with a participation of
    their boasted independence; and it is but too obvious that,
    once estranged from the powerful protection of the United
    Kingdom, you must be reannexed to the dominion of France, from
    which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great
    Britain, at a vast expense of blood and treasure, from no other
    motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the
    oppression of a cruel neighbour. This restitution of Canada to
    the empire of France, was the stipulated reward for the aid
    afforded to the revolted colonies, now the United States; the
    debt is still due, and there can be no doubt but the pledge has
    been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages, or
    rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over
    the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada,
    to become willing subjects, or rather slaves, to the despot who
    rules the nations of continental Europe with a rod of iron? If
    not, arise in a body, exert your energies, co-operate cordially
    with the king's regular forces to repel <a name="Page_190" id=
    "Page_190"></a>the invader, and do not give cause to your
    children, when groaning under the oppression of a foreign
    master, to reproach you with having so easily parted with the
    richest inheritance of this earth&mdash;a participation in the
    name, character, and freedom of Britons!</p>

    <p>The same spirit of justice, which will make every reasonable
    allowance for the unsuccessful efforts of zeal and loyalty,
    will not fail to punish the defalcation of principle. Every
    Canadian freeholder is, by deliberate choice, bound by the most
    solemn oaths to defend the monarchy, as well as his own
    property; to shrink, from that engagement is a treason not to
    be forgiven. Let no man suppose that if, in this unexpected
    struggle, his majesty's arms should be compelled to yield to an
    overwhelming force, the province will be eventually abandoned;
    the endeared relations of its first settlers, the intrinsic
    value of its commerce, and the pretensions of its powerful
    rival to repossess the Canadas, are pledges that no peace will
    be established between the United States and Great Britain and
    Ireland, of which the restoration of these provinces does not
    make the most prominent condition.</p>

    <p>Be not dismayed at the unjustifiable threat of the commander
    of the enemy's forces to refuse quarter, should an Indian
    appear in the ranks. The brave bands of aborigines which
    inhabit this colony were, like his majesty's other subjects,
    punished for their zeal and fidelity, by the loss of their
    possessions in the late colonies, and rewarded by his majesty
    with lands of superior value in this province. The faith of the
    British government has never yet been violated&mdash;the
    Indians feel that the soil they inherit is to them and their
    posterity protected from the base arts so frequently devised to
    over-reach their simplicity. By what new principle are they to
    be prohibited from defending their property? If their warfare,
    from being different to that of the white people, be more
    terrific to the enemy, let him retrace his steps&mdash;- they
    seek him not&mdash;and cannot expect to find women and children
    in an invading <a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>army. But
    they are men, and have equal rights with all other men to
    defend themselves and their property when invaded, more
    especially when they find in the enemy's camp a ferocious and
    mortal foe, using the same warfare which the American commander
    affects to reprobate.</p>

    <p>This inconsistent and unjustifiable threat of refusing
    quarter, for such a cause as being found in arms with a brother
    sufferer, in defence of invaded rights, must be exercised with
    the certain assurance of retaliation, not only in the limited
    operations of war in this part of the king's dominions, but in
    every quarter of the globe; for the national character of
    Britain is not less distinguished for humanity than strict
    retributive justice, which will consider the execution of this
    inhuman threat as deliberate murder, for which every subject of
    the offending power must make expiation.</p>

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, July 20, 1812.</p>

    <p>My last to your excellency was dated the 12th instant, since
    which nothing extraordinary has occurred on this communication.
    The enemy has evidently diminished his force, and appears to
    have no intention of making an immediate attack.</p>

    <p>I have herewith the honor of enclosing the copy of two
    letters which I have received from Lieut.-Colonel St. George,
    together with some interesting documents found on board a
    schooner, which the <a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>boats
    of the Hunter captured on her voyage from the Miami to
    Detroit.</p>

    <p>From the accompanying official correspondence between
    General Hull and the secretary at war, it appears that the
    collected force which has arrived at Detroit amounts to about
    2,000 men. I have requested Colonel Proctor to proceed to
    Amherstburg, and ascertain accurately the state of things in
    that quarter. I had every inclination to go there myself, but
    the meeting of the legislature on the 27th instant renders it
    impossible.</p>

    <p>I receive this moment a dispatch dated the 15th instant,
    from Lieut.-Colonel St. George, giving an account of the enemy
    having landed on the 12th and immediately after occupied the
    village of Sandwich. It is strange that three days should be
    allowed to elapse before sending to acquaint me of this
    important fact. I had no idea, until I received Lieut.-Colonel
    St. George's letter a few days ago that General Hull was
    advancing with so large a force.</p>

    <p>The militia, from every account, behaved very ill. The
    officers appear the most in fault. Colonel Proctor will
    probably reach Amherstburg in the course of to-morrow. I have
    great dependence in that officer's decision, but fear he will
    arrive too late to be of much service. The enemy was not likely
    to delay attacking a force that had allowed him to cross the
    river in open day without firing a shot.</p>

    <p>The position which Lieut.-Colonel St. George <a name=
    "Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>occupied is very good, and
    infinitely more formidable than the fort itself. Should he
    therefore be compelled to retire, I know of no other
    alternative than his embarking in the king's vessels and
    proceeding to Fort Erie.</p>

    <p>Were it possible to animate the militia to a proper sense of
    their duty, something might yet be done&mdash;but I almost
    despair.</p>

    <p>Your excellency will readily perceive the critical situation
    in which the reduction of Amherstburg will place me.</p>

    <p>I do not imagine General Hull will be able to detach more
    than I,000 men, but even with that trifling force I much fear
    he will succeed in getting to my rear. The militia will not act
    without a strong regular force to set them the example; and as
    I must now expect to be seriously threatened, I cannot in
    prudence make strong detachments, which would not only weaken
    my line of defence, but, in the event of a retreat, endanger
    their safety.</p>

    <p>I am now given to understand that General Hull's insidious
    proclamation, herewith enclosed, has already been productive of
    considerable effect on the minds of the people. In fact, a
    general sentiment prevails, that with the present force
    resistance is unavailing. I shall continue to exert myself to
    the utmost to overcome every difficulty. Should, however, the
    communication between Kingston and Montreal be cut off, the
    fate of the troops in this part of the province will be
    decided. <a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>I now express my
    apprehensions on a supposition that the slender means your
    excellency possesses will not admit of diminution;
    consequently, that I need not look for reinforcements. It is
    evidently not the intention of the enemy to make any attempt to
    penetrate into the province by this strait, unless the present
    force be diminished. He seems much more inclined to work on the
    flanks, aware that if he succeed every other part must very
    soon submit.</p>

    <p>My last official communication from the Lower Province is
    dated the 25th ultimo, when the adjutant-general announced the
    receipt of intelligence, by a mercantile house, of war being
    declared by the United States against Great Britain.</p>

  Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>HALIFAX, July 22, 1812.</p>

    <p>Being this moment informed that an express is to be
    dispatched immediately from hence to Quebec, I have great
    pleasure in having an opportunity to inquire after your health
    and welfare, and to acquaint you that your relation, Lady
    Saumarez, and myself, arrived here about a month since. I
    assure you we consider ourselves particularly fortunate in not
    having fallen into the enemy's bands, as the Americans had
    declared war a week before we reached this. We came out in a
    very valuable <a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>ordnance
    store ship, which would have been a great acquisition to the
    enemy, at the breaking out of a war especially; and the loss to
    us would have been seriously felt here, as all the stores on
    board were very much required. Another ship with naval stores
    accompanied us; they were much wanted by our squadron, and
    possibly as much so by the ships of the enemy. Our squadron on
    this station has been very active. Prizes arrive here daily, I
    could almost say hourly. The Emulous brig brought in ten
    yesterday, and 30,000 dollars were found on board some of them.
    Mr. Foster, late ambassador to the American States, has been
    here nearly a week; he is to sail for England to-day. According
    to the best information we can obtain here, the Northern and
    Eastern States of America are extremely inimical to, and
    dissatisfied with, the war; so much so, that there is reason to
    suppose they will dissolve the Union shortly, and declare
    themselves totally independent of the Southern and Western
    States.</p>

    <p>The American privateers are extremely numerous and daring in
    this neighbourhood; and, I am sorry to add, they have proved
    but too successful, having captured several of our vessels
    bound to Quebec and New Brunswick, and some to this port. I
    received a note about an hour ago from Lieut.-Colonel Pearson,
    who sailed from hence last Sunday, with his wife and family,
    for Quebec, being appointed inspecting field officer in Canada,
    to inform me that he had been made prisoner by <a name=
    "Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>an American privateer. Most of our
    ships are looking out for the squadron the Americans have at
    sea, under Commodore Rodgers, who is supposed to have sailed
    from New York with a view to intercept our West India fleet
    homeward bound.</p>

    <p>We are as busy here as possible in placing all our outposts
    in the best state of defence. I suppose you are not less
    so.</p>

    <p>A transport, with 140 men of the Royals, from the West
    Indies to Quebec, was boarded by the Essex American frigate
    about ten days ago, and permitted to proceed, on condition that
    the master of the vessel promised to pay a ransom of 12,000
    dollars for her; and that the officer commanding considered
    himself on parole, and gave his assurance that the troops would
    not fight against the Americans during the war. The transport
    arrived here yesterday, and the remainder of the battalion is
    supposed to have reached Quebec.</p>

    <p>You have probably heard of the many improvements in our
    little island. An excellent road was finished from town to
    Vazon Bay, and from Fort George to Rocquaine; also one from
    town to Lancresse. The Braye du Valle is now under a state of
    cultivation. Roads of communication were nearly finished; one
    of them from what is called the Long Store passes Amherst
    Barracks and my house, and joins the great road to the Forest
    and St. Martin's: the opening of all these have discovered many
    beautiful views, which we did not know the island
    possessed.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>If there should be any
    thing I can do for you or my nephew James Brock, I beg that you
    will afford me the pleasure of executing your commissions. I
    have not time to add more, but to assure you both of Lady S.'s
    and my best wishes and regards.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, July 25, 1812.</p>

    <p>Since my dispatch to your excellency of the 20th instant, I
    have received information of the enemy having made frequent and
    extensive inroads from Sandwich up the river Thames. I have in
    consequence been induced to detach Capt. Chambers with about 50
    of the 41st regiment to the Moravian town, where I have
    directed 200 militia to join him. From the loud and apparently
    warm professions of the Indians residing on the Grand River, I
    made no doubt of finding at all times a large majority ready to
    take the field and act in conjunction with our troops; but
    accounts received this morning state that they have determined
    to remain neutral, and they had consequently refused, with the
    exception of about fifty, to join Captain Chambers'
    detachment.</p>

    <p>I meditated a diversion to the westward, the moment I could
    collect a sufficient number of militia, in the hope of
    compelling General Hull to retreat across the river; but this
    unexpected intelligence has ruined the whole of my plans. The
    militia, which I destined for this service, will now be
    alarmed, and unwilling to leave their families <a name=
    "Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>to the mercy of 400 Indians, whose
    conduct affords such wide room for suspicion; and really to
    expect that this fickle race will remain in a state of
    neutrality in the midst of war, would be truly absurd. The
    Indians have probably been led to this change of sentiment by
    emissaries from General Hull, whose proclamation to the Six
    Nations is herewith enclosed.</p>

    <p>I have not deemed it of sufficient consequence to commence
    active operations on this line, by an attack on Fort Niagara.
    It can be demolished, when found necessary, in half an hour,
    and there my means of annoyance would terminate. To enable the
    militia to acquire some degree of discipline without
    interruption, is of far greater consequence than such a
    conquest. Every thing in my power shall be done to overcome the
    difficulties by which I am surrounded; but without strong
    reinforcements, I fear the country cannot be roused to make
    exertions equal to meet this crisis.</p>

    <p>I proceed immediately to York, to attend the meeting of the
    legislature, and I hope to return on Wednesday. The charge of
    this frontier will in the mean time devolve on Lieut.-Colonel
    Myers, who appears worthy of every confidence. The actual
    invasion of the province has compelled me to recall that
    portion of the militia whom I permitted to return home and work
    at harvest. I am prepared to hear of much discontent in
    consequence; the disaffected will take advantage of it, and add
    fuel to the flame. But it may not be <a name="Page_199" id=
    "Page_199"></a>without reason that I may be accused of having
    already studied their convenience and humour, to the injury of
    the service.</p>

    <p>I should have derived much consolation in the midst of my
    present difficulties had I been honored, previously to the
    meeting of the legislature, with your excellency's
    determination in regard to this province. That it cannot be
    maintained with its present force is very obvious; and unless
    the enemy be driven from Sandwich, it will be impossible to
    avert much longer the impending ruin of the country. Numbers
    have already joined the invading army; commotions are excited;
    and the late occurrences at Sandwich have spread a general
    gloom. I have not heard from Lieut.-Colonel St. George, or from
    any individual at Amherstburg, since I last had the honor of
    addressing your excellency, which makes me apprehensive that
    Colonel Proctor has been detained on his journey too long for
    the good of the service.</p>

    <p>The enemy's cavalry, amounting to about fifty, are led by
    one Watson, a surveyor from Montreal of a desperate character.
    This fellow has been allowed to parade with about twenty men of
    the same description as far as Westminster, vowing as they went
    along the most bitter vengeance against the first characters in
    the province. Nothing can shew more strongly the state of
    apathy which exists in most parts of the country; but I am
    perhaps too liberal in attributing the conduct of the
    inhabitants to that cause.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>Mr. Couche has
    represented to the head of his department the total
    impracticability of carrying on the public service without a
    remittance of specie, or a government paper substitute. He was
    in expectation of making arrangements with some individuals
    that would have enabled him to proceed, but I much fear that
    the whole project has fallen to the ground. The militia on this
    communication were so clamorous for their pay, that I directed
    Mr. Couche to make the necessary advances, and this has drained
    him of the little specie in his possession.</p>

    <p>My present civil office not only authorizes me to convene
    general courts martial for the trial of offenders belonging to
    the militia, but likewise the infliction of the sentence of
    death; whilst, in regard to the military, my power is limited
    to the mere assembling of the court. I beg leave to submit to
    the consideration of your excellency, whether in times like the
    present I ought not to be invested with equal authority over
    each service.</p>

    <p>I herewith have the honor to transmit two letters, one from
    Captain Roberts, commanding at St. Joseph's, and the second
    from Mr. Dickson, a gentleman every way capable of forming a
    correct judgment of the actual state of the Indians. Nothing
    can be more deplorable than his description; yet the United
    States government accuse Great Britain of instigating that
    people to war. Is not the true cause to be found in the state
    of desperation to which they are reduced by the un<a name=
    "Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>friendly and unjust measures of
    that government towards them?</p>

  opened the extra session of the legislature, and delivered the
  following speeches.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Honorable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and
    Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>

    <p>The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration
    which could have induced me to call you together at a time when
    public, as well as private duties elsewhere, demand your care
    and attention.</p>

    <p>But, gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object
    is the entire conquest of the province, the voice of loyalty,
    as well as of interest, calls aloud to every person in the
    sphere in which he is placed to defend his country.</p>

    <p>Our militia have heard that voice, and have obeyed it; they
    have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct,
    that they are worthy of the king whom they serve, and of the
    constitution which they enjoy; and it affords me particular
    satisfaction, that while I address you as legislators, I speak
    to men who, in the day of danger, will be ready to assist, not
    only with their counsel, but with their arms.</p>

    <p>We look, gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the
    regular forces, for our protection; but I should be wanting to
    that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to
    conceal (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, and
    especially of legislators, has discovered,) that amendment is
    necessary in our militia laws to render them efficient.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>It is for you to
    consider what further improvements they still may require.</p>

    <p>Honorable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and
    Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>

    <p>From the history and experience of our mother country, we
    learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion,
    the ordinary course of criminal law has been found inadequate
    to secure his majesty's government from private treachery as
    well as from open disaffection; and that at such times its
    legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining
    for a limited period the liberty of individuals, in many cases
    where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the
    charge; and although the actual invasion of the province might
    justify me in the exercise of the full powers reposed in me on
    such an emergency, yet it will be more agreeable to me to
    receive the sanction of the two houses.</p>

    <p>A few traitors have already joined the enemy, have been
    suffered to come into the country with impunity, and have been
    harboured and concealed in the interior; yet the general spirit
    of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this
    province, is such as to authorize a just expectation that their
    efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing. The
    disaffected, I am convinced, are few&mdash;to protect and
    defend the loyal inhabitants from their machinations, is an
    object worthy of your most serious deliberation.</p>

    <p>Gentlemen of the House of Assembly,</p>

    <p>I have directed the public accounts of the province to be
    laid before you, in as complete a state as this unusual period
    will admit; they will afford you the means of ascertaining to
    what extent you can aid in providing for the extraordinary
    demands occasioned by the employment of the militia, and I
    doubt not but to that extent you will cheerfully
    contribute.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>Honorable Gentlemen of
    the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House of
    Assembly,</p>

    <p>We are engaged in an awful and eventful contest. By
    unanimity and dispatch in our councils, and by vigour in our
    operations, we may teach the enemy this lesson, that a country
    defended by <i>free men</i> enthusiastically devoted to the
    cause of their king and constitution, can never be
    conquered!</p>

    <p>The invasion of the western district by Brigadier-General
    Hull, and the artful and threatening language of his
    proclamation, were productive at the outset of very
    unfavourable effects among a large portion of the inhabitants
    of Upper Canada; and so general was the despondency, that the
    Norfolk militia, consisting, we believe, chiefly of settlers of
    American origin, peremptorily refused to march. The majority of
    the members of the house of assembly were impressed with the
    same gloomy forebodings, and that body appeared by its
    proceedings rather to court the favor of the enemy than
    fearlessly to perform its duty. It was therefore prorogued upon
    passing the money bills, as no advantage could result from its
    remaining longer in session. The state of the province required
    the most prompt and decisive measures for its preservation, and
    Major-General Brock considered its situation at this moment as
    extremely critical. With the concurrence of his council, to
    whom he represented his many difficulties, he is said to have
    resolved on exercising martial law whenever he should find it
    necessary, although the house of assembly had rejected its
    enactment, even <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>in a
    modified form. Not only among the militia was a disposition
    evinced to submit tamely, but five hundred in the western
    district sought the protection of the enemy. It is true that
    the people then were far removed from the seat of government,
    and the more subject to hostile influence, as they were
    principally composed of French Canadians and of the natives of
    the United States, or their immediate descendants; but even the
    Indians, who were located on the Grand River, in the heart of
    the province, positively refused, with a few exceptions, to
    take up arms; and they announced their intention, after the
    return of some of their chiefs from General Hull, to remain
    neutral, as if they wished the authorities to believe that they
    would remain in peace in the midst of war. Major-General Brock
    had not long administered the government of the province, but
    where he was individually known, and where his personal
    influence extended, a better feeling prevailed; and his
    counter-proclamation served not only to animate the well
    disposed, but to counteract the machinations of the
    disaffected. The confident tone of his address to the
    provincial parliament was also productive of the best effects,
    whatever inward misgivings he might feel; and those who were
    dastardly enough to join the invaders of their native or
    adopted country, were quickly taught to repent of their
    baseness and treason.</p>

  <h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><a name="Page_205" id=
  "Page_205"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p>We have mentioned that Major-General Brock had in the spring
  provided for the protection of Fort St. Joseph, a small British
  post, distant by water nearly 700 hundred miles from York, and
  situate about 40 miles, also by water, to the north-east of the
  American island and fort of Michilimakinack, or Makinack, which
  island is in latitude 45&deg; 35' north, and longitude 84&deg;
  30' west; and one of his first cares, on hearing of the
  declaration of the war, was to send, on the 26th of June, a
  notification of it to Captain Roberts, who was stationed at St.
  Joseph with a detachment of the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion,
  accompanied by orders to make an immediate attack upon
  Michilimakinack, if practicable; or, in the event of an attack by
  the Americans upon St. Joseph, to defend it to the utmost.
  Captain Roberts received at the same time another letter from
  Major-General Brock, dated the 27th June, suspending the orders
  for the attack from the uncertainty he was under of the
  declaration of war. In a third letter, dated Fort George, the
  28th June, Major-General Brock, being sufficiently informed of
  such a declaration, directed Captain Roberts to adopt <a name=
  "Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>the most prompt and effectual
  measures to possess himself of Michilimakinack, and for this
  purpose to summon to his assistance the Indians within his
  influence, as well as the gentlemen and dependants of the British
  fur companies near his post. On the day that Captain Roberts
  received this letter, another reached him from Sir George
  Prevost, dated Quebec, 25th of June, by which he was directed to
  take every precaution to secure his post against any attempt by
  the enemy, and, in case of necessity, to effect his
  retreat.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> This contrariety of
  instructions from the two general officers did not fail to
  perplex Captain Roberts, who, however, with great promptitude and
  decision made preparations for the attack. By another dispatch of
  the 4th of July, from Major-General Brock, Captain Roberts was
  left at his own discretion to adopt either offensive or defensive
  measures, as circumstances might dictate. On the 16th July, he
  accordingly set out with a flotilla of boats and canoes, in which
  were embarked 45 officers and men of the 10th Royal Veteran
  Battalion, about 180 Canadians, and nearly 400 Indians, the whole
  convoyed by the Caledonia brig, belonging to the North-West
  company; and on the ensuing morning, the British force effected a
  landing before Michilimakinack,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id=
  "FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class=
  "fnanchor">[59]</a> the garrison of which, consisting only of 61
  officers and men, <a name="Page_207" id=
  "Page_207"></a>immediately surrendered by capitulation. A
  quantity of military stores and seven hundred packs of furs were
  found in the fort, and its surrender had a very favorable effect
  upon the Indians, a large number of whom now joined in open
  hostility against the Americans. It will be found by a letter of
  the 12th August, from Sir George Prevost, who appears to have
  seen no safety but in defensive measures, that he would
  <i>not</i> have approved of the attack on Michilimakinack if it
  had occurred prior to Hull's invasion! And yet that officer, in
  his official dispatch relative to the capture of his army and the
  surrender of Detroit, attributed his disasters partly to the fall
  of Michilimakinack, which he said opened the northern hive of
  Indians against him!</p>

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, July 29, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have the honor to transmit herewith a dispatch this
    instant received from Captain Roberts, announcing the surrender
    by capitulation, on the 17th instant, of Fort
    Michilimakinack.</p>

    <p>The conduct of this officer since his appointment to the
    command of that distant post, has been distinguished by much
    zeal and judgment, and his recent eminent display of those
    qualities your excellency will find has been attended with the
    most happy effect.</p>

    <p>The militia stationed here volunteered this morning their
    services to any part of the province <a name="Page_208" id=
    "Page_208"></a>without the least hesitation. I have selected
    100, whom I have directed to proceed without delay to Long
    Point, where I purpose collecting a force for the relief of
    Amherstburg. This example, I hope, will be followed by as many
    as may be required. By the militia law, a mail refusing to
    march may be fined &pound;5, or confined three months; and
    although I have assembled the legislature for the express
    purpose of amending the act, I much fear nothing material will
    be done. Your excellency will scarcely believe, that this
    infatuated house of assembly have refused, by a majority of
    two, to suspend for a limited time the habeas corpus.</p>

    <p>The capture of Michilimakinack may produce great changes to
    the westward. The actual invasion of the province justifies
    every act of hostility on the American territory.</p>

    <p>It was not till this morning that I was honored with your
    excellency's dispatches, dated the 7th and 10th instant. Their
    contents, I beg to assure your excellency, have relieved my
    mind considerably. I doubt whether General Hull had
    instructions to cross to this side of the river; I rather
    suspect he was compelled by a want of provisions. I embark
    immediately in the Prince Regent for Fort George. I return here
    the day after to-morrow, and shall probably dissolve the
    legislature.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><i>Sir George Prevost to
  Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, July 31, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have received your letter of the 20th instant, accompanied
    by the copy of two letters from Lieut.-Colonel St. George, who
    is in command at Amherstburg, and some interesting documents
    found on board a schooner, which had been taken by the boats of
    the Hunter.</p>

    <p>In consequence of your having desired Colonel Proctor to
    proceed to Amherstburg, and of your presence being necessary at
    the seat of government to meet the legislature of Upper Canada,
    I have taken upon myself to place Major-General Sheaffe on the
    staff, to enable me to send him to assist you in the arduous
    task you have to perform, in the able execution of which I have
    great confidence. He has been accordingly directed to proceed
    without delay to Upper Canada, there to place himself under
    your command.</p>

    <p>I believe you are authorized by the commission under which
    you administer the government of Upper Canada, to declare
    martial law in the event of invasion or insurrection; it is
    therefore for you to consider whether you can obtain any thing
    equivalent to that power from your legislature. I have not
    succeeded in obtaining a modification of it in Lower Canada,
    and must therefore, upon the occurrence of either of those
    calamities, declare the law martial unqualified, and of course
    shut the doors of the courts of civil law.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>The report transmitted
    by Captain Dixon, of the Royal Engineers, to Lieut.-Colonel
    Bruyeres, of the state of defence in which he had placed Fort
    Amherstburg, together with the description of the troops
    allotted for its defence, give me a foreboding that the result
    of General Hull's attempt upon that fort will terminate
    honorably to our arms.</p>

    <p>If Lieut.-Colonel St. George be possessed of the talents and
    resources required to form a soldier, he is fortunate in the
    opportunity of displaying them. Should General Hull be
    compelled to relinquish his operations against Amherstburg, it
    will be proper his future movements should be most carefully
    observed, as his late march exhibits a more than ordinary
    character of enterprize.</p>

    <p>Your supposition of my slender means is but too correct;
    notwithstanding, you may rely upon every exertion being made to
    preserve uninterrupted the communication between Kingston and
    Montreal, and that I will also give all possible support to
    your endeavours to overcome every difficulty.</p>

    <p>The possession of Malden, which I consider means
    Amherstburg, appears a favorite object with the government of
    the United States. I sincerely hope you will disappoint
    them.</p>

    <p>Should the intelligence, which arrived yesterday by the way
    of Newfoundland, prove correct, a remarkable coincidence will
    exist in the revocation of our orders in council as regards
    America, and the declaration of war by congress against
    England, both having taken place on the same day in London and
    at Washington, the 17th June.</p>
  </div>

  Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, August 1, 1812.</p>

    <p>Sir George yesterday received your letter of the 20th with
    its several enclosures, which are, I assure you, highly
    interesting to all, and doubly so to those who feel warmly and
    sincerely attached to you; and few, I believe, possess more
    friends and well wishers than yourself. 100 effective of the
    Newfoundland, and 50 picked men of the Veterans, left this in
    boats on Thursday, and, as it has blown a gale of east wind
    ever since, have I trust made great progress: they were
    intended to reinforce the garrison of Kingston, and to relieve
    the company of the 49th that escorted stores to that place. Sir
    George regrets extremely his inability to render you a more
    efficient aid, but, under existing circumstances, he does not
    feel himself warranted to do more. I regret to find your
    militia at Sandwich so lukewarm, to call it by no harsher name;
    but I fear that little can be expected from those recently
    settled, or of American extraction, and with our Canadians we
    have found a very reluctant compliance. I trust we may still
    look to considerable reinforcements from home this year. We are
    led to expect the 1st battalion of the Royals from the West
    Indies immediately, destined indeed to relieve the 41st. I hope
    we shall not be disappointed, as our militia will feel bold if
    well backed; and I am sure Sir George will rejoice in receiving
    the means of rendering <a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>you
    further assistance. It appears to be credited that the orders
    in council were rescinded, in as far as regarded America, on
    the 17th June, the day the war vote was carried: this will
    strengthen the oppositionists in the States, and the timid will
    feel alarmed, not without reason, when they read the glorious
    and judicious exploit of Captain Hotham, in the Northumberland,
    74, in destroying, under circumstances of great difficulty and
    peril, two French 44-gun frigates and a sloop, which received a
    superior degree of protection from batteries on the shore than
    can be afforded to Commodore Rodgers in any harbour of the
    States.</p>

    <p>The Americans are forming dep&ocirc;ts in the neighbourhood
    of the Montreal frontier and building batteries on the lake,
    but they have not brought forward any considerable shew of
    strength;&mdash;on this appearance of weakness we cannot rely,
    as it would answer no good end making a parade before they
    intended to attack. If they be serious in their views on this
    province, the attempt will be probably backed by predatory
    incursions on various points. A corps of militia is kept on the
    Point Levi side.</p>

    <p>Our legislature meet this day to terminate the session. One
    great object has been accomplished in the house, adding the
    provincial security to the army money note bill; the province
    pays the interest accruing upon the notes and the expense of
    the establishment, and they are constituted a legal tender.
    Without this step we were completely at <a name="Page_213" id=
    "Page_213"></a>a stand, for we could not obtain money to pay
    the last month's subsistence to the troops: great benefit is
    expected to accrue from the operation of the bill. The clergy
    have engaged to promote the circulation of the notes, all of
    which above twenty-five dollars bear interest, and all under
    are payable on demand.</p>

    <p>Adieu, my dear generals&mdash;may every success and good
    fortune attend you in the arduous task before you: we cannot
    command success, but I am sure you will not fail to merit
    it.</p>

  Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, August 1, 1812.</p>

    <p>I take the favorable advantage of this being delivered to
    you by General Sheaffe, to assure you of the sincere interest I
    feel in the very arduous and important position you are now
    placed in to protect and defend a chain of posts, and a country
    that has been so long neglected. This difficult task placed in
    any other hands, I should consider very discouraging; but I
    acknowledge that I look with a certain degree of confidence to
    your abilities and perseverance in surmounting every difficulty
    that must unavoidably occur in a service of this nature. I most
    fervently and earnestly hope that every possible success may
    attend all your proceedings. I trust that you will always meet
    with zeal and activity in the officers of my department, to
    perform every part of the duty allotted <a name="Page_214" id=
    "Page_214"></a>to their charge. It is very difficult at this
    distance to suggest any ideas that might be useful, as every
    operation in which you are engaged must depend so entirely upon
    local circumstances, and the conduct which the enemy may pursue
    towards attaining the object he has in view. I am glad to find
    that the new arrival of the Royals, expected at Quebec
    to-morrow, will give you the reinforcement of the 49th
    regiment, which, with the detachments of the Newfoundland and
    Veterans, and gun-boat No. 7, will add something to your
    present strength.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>QUEBEC, August 2, 1812.</p>

    <p>Last evening an officer of the 98th regiment arrived here
    express from Halifax, the bearer of dispatches to me, dated on
    the 22d ultimo, from Mr. Foster, who was then in Nova
    Scotia.</p>

    <p>I lose no time in making you acquainted with the substance
    of this gentleman's communication. He informs me that he had
    just received dispatches from England, referring to a
    declaration of ministers in parliament, relative to a proposed
    repeal of the orders in council, provided the United States
    government would return to relations of amity with us, the
    contents of which may possibly induce the American government
    to agree to a suspension of hostilities as a preliminary to
    negotiations for peace;&mdash;that he proposed sending his
    majesty's hired armed ketch Gleaner to <a name="Page_215" id=
    "Page_215"></a>New York, with letters to Mr. Baker, whom he had
    left at Washington in a demi-official capacity, with directions
    to communicate with the American minister and to write to me
    the result of his interview. Should the president of the United
    States think proper to signify that hostile operations should
    cease on the American side, Mr. Foster suggests the expediency
    of my being prepared to make a similar signification on our
    part.</p>

    <p>As I propose sending Colonel Baynes immediately into the
    United States, with a proposal for a cessation of hostile
    operations, I enclose for your information the copy of my
    letter to General Dearborn, or the commander-in-chief of the
    American forces.</p>

    <p>Mr. Foster also submits the propriety of our abstaining from
    an invasion of the United States territory, as only in such an
    event could the American government be empowered to order the
    militia out of the States. I am led to believe from this, that
    General Hull, in possessing himself of Sandwich, has exceeded
    his instructions; particularly as Mr. Foster informs me that
    Mr. Monroe had told him Fort Maiden (Amherstburg) would not be
    attacked, but that General Hull had stated to a friend of his,
    some time ago, that he would attempt it.</p>

    <p>A report has been made to me that a frigate and six
    transports, with the Royal Scots (1st battalion) on board, from
    the West Indies, are just below Bic;&mdash;in consequence of
    this reinforcement, I <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>have
    ordered the company of the 49th regiment, sent to Kingston, to
    remain there; and in addition to the Royal Newfoundland
    Regiment, and a detachment of an officer and 50 Veterans most
    fit for service, now on their route to that station, I shall
    order Major Ormsby, with three companies of the 49th regiment,
    to proceed from Montreal to the same post, to be disposed of as
    you may find it necessary.</p>

    <p>Lieut.-General Sir J.C. Sherbrooke has informed me that one
    of the transports, with part of the Royals on board, has been
    captured by the United States frigate the Essex; that she has
    been ransomed and the officers and troops allowed to proceed,
    upon condition that they are not to serve against America until
    regularly exchanged. The vessel and troops had arrived at
    Halifax, and will shortly be sent hither.</p>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, August 12, 1812.</p>

    <p>Your letter of the 4th instant, enclosing the proceedings of
    the executive council of the 3d.; Captain Glegg's letter of the
    5th instant, transmitting copies of letters from Colonel
    Proctor to you of 26th and 30th July, with the correspondence
    between Brigadier-General Hull and Lieut.-Colonel St. George,
    and the intercepted correspondence of the former, together with
    your letter to Colonel Baynes, of the 4th instant, were all
    delivered to me on my arrival at this place yesterday. The
    information they contain is highly interesting, and I lose no
    time in dispatching to you Brigade Major Shekleton, as the
    bearer of this letter, and for the purpose of receiving
    whatever communication you may have to make in return. Being
    fully aware of the necessity of affording you such
    reinforcements as the exigencies of the service in other parts
    of the two provinces would permit, I had, previous to the
    receipt of your letter, made arrangements for that purpose.</p>

    <p>Major Ormsby, with three companies of the <a name="Page_218"
    id="Page_218"></a>49th regiment, protecting a considerable
    supply of ordnance and ordnance stores, left La Chine on the
    6th instant for Kingston and Fort George, taking with him
    &pound;2,500 for the payment of the regular and militia forces.
    Major Heathcote, with one company of the 49th regiment, about
    110 men of the Newfoundland regiment, and 50 picked Veterans,
    are to leave La Chine on the 13th instant. With this
    detachment, an additional supply of ordnance stores and camp
    equipage for 500 men will be forwarded for Upper Canada; and as
    soon as a sufficiency of bateaux can again be collected at La
    Chine, Colonel Vincent is under orders to proceed to Kingston
    with the remainder of the 49th regiment, and a subaltern of the
    royal artillery and ten gunners, with two 3-pounders.</p>

    <p>When these reinforcements reach you, they will, I trust,
    enable you successfully to resist the internal, as well as
    external, enemies opposed to you, and materially aid the able
    measures you have adopted for the defence of Upper Canada.</p>

    <p>With regard to the queries you have submitted to me on the
    subject of martial law, I have to observe, that it has not
    fallen within my experience to see martial law proclaimed,
    except in those places where it has been declared under the
    authority of a provincial legislature, which of course
    regulated the mode in which it was to be executed. As the
    martial law which you purpose declaring is founded on the
    king's commission, and upon the extreme case of invasion
    alluded to in it, I am <a name="Page_219" id=
    "Page_219"></a>inclined to think that whatever power is
    necessary for carrying the measure into effect, must have been
    intended to be given you by the commission, and consequently,
    that the power of assembling courts martial and of carrying
    their sentence into execution, is included in the authority for
    declaring martial law. The officers of militia becoming
    themselves subject to martial law when it is declared, I
    conceive they may sit upon courts martial with officers of his
    majesty's regular forces; but upon both these points I desire
    not to be understood as speaking decisively&mdash;extreme cases
    must be met by measures which, on ordinary occasions, would not
    perhaps be justified. Your situation is such as to warrant your
    resorting to any step which, in your judgment, the public
    safety may require. I should therefore think, that after taking
    the best opinions you can obtain from the first law characters
    you have about you respecting the doubts you entertain on this
    subject, you need not hesitate to determine upon that line of
    conduct which you shall think will best promote the good of the
    service, trusting, if you do err, to the absolute necessity of
    the measures you may adopt, as your justification for them to
    his majesty's government.</p>

    <p>Your letters of the 26th, 28th and 29th July, with the
    several enclosures and papers accompanying them, were received
    by me shortly previous to my leaving Quebec; the last
    containing Captain Roberts' official account of the capture of
    Fort <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>Michilimakinack.
    Great credit is certainly due to that officer for the zeal and
    promptitude with which he has performed this service; at the
    same time I must confess, my mind has been very much relieved
    by finding that the capture took place at a period subsequent
    to Brigadier-General Hull's invasion of the province, as, had
    it been prior to it, it would not only have been in violation
    of Captain Roberts' orders, but have afforded a just ground for
    the subsequent conduct of the enemy, which, I now plainly
    perceive, no forbearance on your part would have prevented. The
    capture of this place will, I hope, enable the Indian tribes in
    that quarter to co-operate with you in your present movements
    against the enemy, by threatening his flanks, a diversion which
    would greatly alarm him, and probably have the effect of
    compelling him to retreat across the river.</p>

    <p>I send you enclosed a copy of the official repeal of the
    orders in council, which I received last night by express from
    Quebec. Although I much doubt whether this step on the part of
    our government will have any effect upon that of the United
    States, the circulation of the paper evincing their
    conciliatory disposition may tend to increase and strengthen
    the divisions which subsist amongst the people upon the subject
    of the war. I therefore recommend to you to have a number of
    copies struck off and distributed.</p>

    <p>Colonel Baynes is still absent upon his mission to the
    enemy's camp. Your letter to him of the <a name="Page_221" id=
    "Page_221"></a>29th ultimo was received at the same time with
    those I have last acknowledged. Colonel Lethbridge I have
    directed to return to Montreal.</p>

    <p>The issue of army bills has taken place at Quebec, and I
    hope to be able shortly to send you a supply of them.</p>

  <p>We have previously alluded (page <a href='#Page_206'>206</a>)
  to that part of the preceding letter which relates to the capture
  of Michilimakinack. This capture appears to have been effected
  <i>contrary</i> to Sir George Prevost's orders, as Fort St.
  Joseph being nearly 350 miles from Detroit and Sandwich, and as
  the expedition left the fort only four days after Hull's
  invasion, it was scarcely possible that Captain Roberts was then
  aware of that circumstance. Neither in his letter to the
  adjutant-general, announcing the capture, does he excuse himself
  by stating that he had heard of the invasion. In his dispatch to
  Earl Bathurst, written exactly a fortnight after the preceding
  letter, and dated Montreal, August 26, Sir George Prevost, in
  communicating the surrender of Detroit, expressed himself in very
  altered language, as he said:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"In these measures he<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id=
    "FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class=
    "fnanchor">[60]</a> was most opportunely aided by the fortunate
    surrender of Fort Michilimakinack, which, giving spirit and
    confidence to the Indian tribes in its neighbourhood, part of
    whom assisted in its capture, determined them to advance upon
    the rear and flanks of the American army, as soon as they heard
    that it had entered the province."</p>

  <p>Whilst Major-General Brock impatiently lingered on the Niagara
  frontier, so as to give time to the legislature to assemble at
  York, he dispatched Colonel Proctor, of the 41st regiment, with
  such reinforcements as could be spared, to assume the command at
  Amherstburg. General Hull, after crossing to Sandwich, remained
  for some time inactive, under pretext of making preparations for
  the reduction of Amherstburg, or Malden, as the Americans called
  it, which lay but eighteen miles below him, and was not in a
  condition to withstand a regular siege. During the delay, three
  detachments of his army were on three successive days beaten back
  by a small number of the 41st regiment and a few Indians.
  Michilimakinack had fallen since the invasion, and the Indians
  from that quarter were flocking to the British standard. Our
  naval force being superior on the lake, Colonel Proctor pushed
  over to Brownstown, an American village, about 25 miles from
  Detroit, and nearly opposite to Amherstburg, a small detachment
  of the 41st regiment, and some Indians under the celebrated
  Tecumseh, who, with 70 of the latter, awaited in ambush near that
  <a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>village a party of 200
  Americans, under Major Van Home, on their march<a name=
  "FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> from Detroit to the
  River Raisin, (40 miles south of Detroit,) to meet a detachment
  of volunteers from Ohio, with a convoy of provisions for Hull's
  army. The Indians, firing suddenly, killed 20, including 5
  officers, and wounded about the same number of the Americans, who
  hastily retreated, and were pursued seven miles by the warriors
  alone, not a British soldier being engaged. In this affair,
  General Hull's dispatches and the correspondence of his troops
  fell into the hands of Tecumseh, and it was partly the desponding
  nature of their contents which afterwards induced Major-General
  Brock to attempt the capture of the American army. Foiled in the
  reduction of Fort Amherstburg; disappointed in his hope of a
  general insurrection of the Canadians; and, "above all, dismayed
  at the report of General Brock's resolution to advance against
  him,"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Hull's schemes of
  conquest vanished; and he who, less than a month before, had
  landed in Canada boastful of his strength and with threats of
  extermination, now saw no other alternative than a hasty return
  to Detroit, under the pretence of concentrating his forces; and
  after re-opening his communication with the rivers Raisin and
  Miami, through which he received his <a name="Page_224" id=
  "Page_224"></a>supplies, of resuming offensive operations.
  Accordingly, on the 7th and 8th of August the American army
  re-crossed the river, with the exception of a garrison of 250 men
  left in charge of a small fortification they had thrown up on the
  British side, a little below Detroit, and which they evacuated
  and destroyed before the arrival of Major-General Brock.<a name=
  "FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> On the 9th of August,
  a body of 600 Americans, sent to dislodge the British from
  Brownstown and to open a communication with the Rivers Raisin and
  Miami, was met by the white troops and Indians under Captain
  Muir, of the 41st, at Maguaga, between Brownstown and Detroit,
  but, after a severe conflict, Captain Muir was compelled to
  retreat.</p>

  <p>From the moment that Major-General Brock heard of the invasion
  of the western district, he determined on proceeding thither in
  person after he had met the legislature and dispatched the public
  business. Having expressed a wish of being accompanied by such of
  the militia as might voluntarily offer their services, 500,
  principally the sons of veteran soldiers who had settled in the
  province, cheerfully came forward for that purpose. The
  threatening attitude, however, of the enemy on the Niagara
  frontier, obliged the general to content himself with half this
  number; and he left York on the 6th of August for Burlington Bay,
  whence he proceeded by land for Long Point, on Lake Erie. In
  passing the Mohawks' village, <a name="Page_225" id=
  "Page_225"></a>on the Grand River, or Ouse, he desired the
  Indians there to tell him who were, and who were not, his
  friends; and at a council held on the 7th of August, they
  promised that about 60 of their number should follow him on the
  ensuing Monday, the 10th. At Long Point, a few regulars and
  nearly 300 militia embarked with him on the 8th of the same month
  in boats of every description, collected among the neighbouring
  farmers, who usually employed them for transporting their corn
  and flour. The distance from Long Point to Amherstburg is about
  200 miles along the shore, which in many parts is a high
  precipitous bank of red clay, with scarcely a creek for shelter.
  The little flotilla encountered heavy rain and tempestuous
  weather, but nothing could for a moment retard its progress, or
  diminish the confidence of the men in their indefatigable leader.
  Among his general orders from the commencement of hostilities,
  the only one relating to this voyage is the following, which,
  from the singularity of the circumstances attending it, is
  thought worthy of being preserved:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>G.O. Head Quarters, Pointe au Prince, Aug. 12, 1812.</p>

    <p>It is Major-General Brock's intention, should the wind
    continue fair, to proceed during the night; officers commanding
    boats will therefore pay attention to the order of sailing, as
    directed yesterday; the greatest care and attention will be
    required to prevent the boats from separating or <a name=
    "Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>falling behind. A great part of
    the banks of the lake, where the boats will this day pass, is
    much more dangerous and difficult of access than any we have
    passed; the boats will, therefore, not land except in the most
    extreme necessity, and then great care must be taken to choose
    the best place for beaching.</p>

    <p>The troops being now in the neighbourhood of the enemy,
    every precaution must be taken to guard against surprise. By
    Order.</p>

    <p>J.B. GLEGG, Aide-de-Camp.</p>
  </div>

  <p>After five days and nights of incessant exertion, the little
  squadron reached Amherstburg<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
  "FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class=
  "fnanchor">[64]</a> shortly before midnight on the 13th, and in a
  rough sketch in the handwriting of Major-General Brock, he
  observed: "In no instance have I seen troops who would have
  endured the fatigues of a long journey in boats, during extremely
  bad weather, with greater cheerfulness and constancy; and it is
  but justice to this little band to add, that their conduct
  throughout excited my admiration."</p>

  <p>Soon after their landing at Amherstburg, the attention of the
  troops was suddenly roused by a straggling fire of musketry,
  which in a few minutes became general, and appeared to proceed
  from an island in the Detroit river. Colonel Elliott, the
  superintendent of the Indians, quickly explained <a name=
  "Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>that the firing arose from the
  Indians attached to the British cause, who thus expressed their
  joy at the arrival of the reinforcement under their white father.
  Major-General Brock, aware of his scarcity of the munitions of
  war, sent Colonel Elliott to stop this waste of powder, saying:
  "Do, pray, Elliott, fully explain my wishes and motives, and tell
  the Indians that I will speak to them to-morrow on this subject."
  His request was promptly attended to, and Colonel Elliott
  returned in about half an hour with the Shawanee chief, Tecumseh,
  or Tecumpth&eacute;, already mentioned. Captain Glegg,<a name=
  "FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the aide-de-camp,
  being present, had an opportunity of closely observing the traits
  of that extraordinary man, and we are indebted to him for the
  following graphic particulars: "Tecumseh's appearance was very
  prepossessing; his figure light and finely proportioned; his age
  I imagined to be about five and thirty;<a name="FNanchor_66_66"
  id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class=
  "fnanchor">[66]</a> in height, five feet nine or ten inches; his
  complexion, light copper; countenance, oval, with bright hazle
  eyes, beaming cheerfulness, energy, and decision. Three small
  silver crowns, or coronets, were suspended from the lower
  cartilage of his aquiline nose; and a large silver medallion of
  George the Third, which I believe his ancestor had received from
  Lord Dorchester, when governor-general of Canada, was attached to
  a mixed coloured wampum string, and hung round his neck. His
  dress consisted of a plain, neat <a name="Page_228" id=
  "Page_228"></a>uniform, tanned deer skin jacket, with long
  trousers of the same material, the seams of both being covered
  with neatly cut fringe; and he had on his feet leather mocassins,
  much ornamented with work made from the dyed quills of the
  porcupine.</p>

  <p>"The first and usual salutation of shaking hands being over,
  an allusion was made to the late firing of musketry, and Tecumseh
  at once approved of the reason given by Major-General Brock for
  its discontinuance. It being late, the parties soon separated,
  with an understanding that a council would be held the following
  morning. This accordingly took place, and was attended by about a
  thousand Indians, whose equipment generally might be considered
  very imposing. The council was opened by General Brock, who
  informed the Indians that he was ordered by their great father to
  come to their assistance, and, with their aid, to drive the
  Americans from Fort Detroit. His speech was highly applauded, and
  Tecumseh was unanimously called upon to speak in reply. He
  commenced with expressions of joy, that their father beyond the
  great salt lake (meaning the king of England) had at length awoke
  from his long sleep, and permitted his warriors to come to the
  assistance of his red children, who had never ceased to remain
  steady in their friendship, and were now all ready to shed their
  last drop of blood in their great father's service. After some
  speeches from other chiefs, and replies thereto, the council
  broke up. General Brock, having quickly disco<a name="Page_229"
  id="Page_229"></a>vered the superior sagacity and intrepidity of
  Tecumseh, and his influence over the Indians, and not deeming it
  prudent to develop before so mixed an assemblage the views which
  were at that moment uppermost in his thoughts, and intended to be
  carried so quickly into execution, directed Colonel Elliott to
  inform this Shawanee chief that he wished to see him, accompanied
  by a few of the oldest chiefs, at Colonel Elliott's quarters.
  There the general, through the medium of interpreters,
  communicated his views, and explained the manner in which he
  intended to carry into execution his operations against Fort
  Detroit. The chiefs listened with the most apparent eagerness,
  and expressed their unanimous assent to the proposed plan,
  assuring General Brock that their co-operation, as pointed out,
  might be depended on. On General Brock asking whether the
  Shawanee Indians could be induced to refrain from drinking
  spirits, Tecumseh assured him that his warriors might be relied
  on, adding, that before leaving their country on the Wabash
  river, they had promised him not to taste that pernicious liquor
  until they had humbled the "big knives," meaning the Americans.
  In reply to this assurance, General Brock briefly said: 'If this
  resolution be persevered in, you must conquer.'"</p>

  <p>In a general order on the 14th of August, at Amherstburg, in
  announcing his arrival in the western district, Major-General
  Brock observed: "The major-general cannot avoid expressing his
  <a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>surprise at the numerous
  desertions which have occurred from the ranks of the militia, to
  which circumstance the long stay of the enemy on this side of the
  river must in a great measure be ascribed. He is willing to
  believe that their conduct proceeded from an anxiety to get in
  their harvest, and not from any predeliction for the principles
  or government of the United States."</p>

  <p>The next day, the American commander was startled by a summons
  to surrender; and so resolute a demand seems to have struck him
  with dismay, as at the worst he had never contemplated a pursuit
  into his own territory.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">

    <p>I have received your letter of this date. I have no other

  Brigadier-General,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Commanding the N.W. Army of the
  U.S.</span><br />

  <p>Nothing daunted, and contrary to the advice of some of his
  officers, Major-General Brock at once determined on crossing the
  river, with the view of attempting, by a sudden and resolute
  attack, the annihilation of the enemy's power in that quarter. In
  the afternoon, a fire was opened from a battery of five guns,
  erected opposite to Detroit, under the direction of Captain
  Dixon, of the Royal Engineers: this cannonade was returned from
  seven 24-pounders, but the British general, perceiving that
  little effect was produced by either fire, gave orders that his
  should cease. The troops retired to their bivouac and lay on
  their arms, with orders to cross the strait, or river, which is
  here about three-fourths of a mile in width, on the following
  morning. Accordingly, at the first blush of dawn, on Sunday, the
  16th of August, when the fire from the British battery was
  resumed, 330 regulars and 400 militia were embarked, with five
  pieces of light artillery, in boats and canoes of every
  description, and soon effected a landing without opposition, near
  Springwell, four or five <a name="Page_232" id=
  "Page_232"></a>miles below Detroit. About 600 Indians, under
  Colonel Elliott, had crossed the river during the night, and were
  ordered to be so placed as to take the enemy in flank and rear,
  should he attempt to oppose the landing. The white troops marched
  towards the fort, while the Indians moved through the woods, and
  covered the left flank, the right resting upon the river, and
  protected by the Queen Charlotte, colonial vessel of war. The
  enemy's effective force was estimated at nearly 2,500 men, and,
  supported as they were by a neighbouring fortress, it required no
  little daring to pursue them on their own ground with such
  unequal numbers. Contrary to Major-General Brock's expectation,
  the Americans abandoned a favorable position, strengthened by
  pickets and two 24-pounders, and retreated into the fort on the
  advance of the British, who halted in a ravine within a mile,
  and, discovering the weakness of the works on the land side,
  prepared for its assault. While the various columns were forming
  for that purpose, a flag of truce, borne by Captain Hull, was
  unexpectedly seen emerging from the fort,&mdash;Lieut.-Colonel
  M'Donell and Captain Glegg accompanied him back; and shortly
  after the British troops marched in with Major-General Brock at
  their head, the American general having assented to a
  capitulation, by which the Michigan territory, Fort Detroit, with
  thirty-three pieces of cannon,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id=

  "fnanchor">[69]</a> and about 2,500 troops, including one company
  of artillery, some cavalry, and the entire 4th U.S. regiment of
  infantry, with a stand of colours, were surrendered to the
  British arms. An immense quantity of stores and the military
  chest were also taken; and as there was a great deficiency of
  arms in the Upper Province wherewith to equip the militia, the
  2,500 stand of American became a valuable acquisition. To this
  surrender the after preservation of Upper Canada, at least, may
  in a great measure be ascribed, as it caused a delay of nearly a
  whole year in the meditated invasion,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id=
  "FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class=
  "fnanchor">[70]</a> and secured the support of some of the Indian
  tribes, who were hesitating as to the side they should espouse.
  It was the more fortunate that Major-General Brock acted with so
  much promptitude and vigour, because large reinforcements were on
  their way to General Hull; and not only would that officer's
  reverse otherwise have been spared, but the western districts of
  Upper Canada would probably have fallen before the overwhelming
  numbers which would soon have been brought against them.</p>

  <p>The surrender of Detroit was so unexpected, that it produced
  an almost electrical effect throughout the Canadas: it was the
  first enterprize in which the militia had been engaged, and its
  success not only imparted confidence to that body, but it
  inspired the timid, fixed the wavering, and awed the <a name=
  "Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>disaffected. Major-General Brock
  from this moment became the idol of the great mass of those whom
  he governed; and when he returned to York, whither he arrived on
  the 27th of August, he was received amidst the heartfelt
  acclamations of a grateful people, rescued by his promptitude
  from the ignominy of submitting to a conqueror. They remembered
  that in the short space of nineteen days he had, not only met the
  legislature and settled the public business of the province under
  the most trying circumstances that a commander could encounter,
  but, with means incredibly limited, he had gone nearly 300 miles
  in pursuit of an invading enemy of almost double his own force
  and compelled him to surrender, thus extending the British
  dominion without bloodshed over an extent of country almost equal
  to Upper Canada.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id=
  "FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class=
  "fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

  <p>The conduct of the American general in so tamely surrendering
  is inexplicable, as Detroit contained an ample supply of
  ammunition and provisions for nearly a month, besides an
  abundance of wheat in the territory, with mills to grind any
  quantity into flour. One of his officers, Colonel Cass, in a long
  letter to the Honorable William Eustis, the secretary of war at
  Washington, said: "I have been informed by Colonel Findley, who
  saw the return of the quartermaster-general the day after the
  surrender, that their whole force, of every description, white,
  red, and black, was 1,030.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id=
  "FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class=
  "fnanchor">[72]</a> They had twenty-nine platoons, <a name=
  "Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>twelve in a platoon, of men dressed
  in uniform. Many of these were evidently Canadian militia. The
  rest of their militia increased their white force to about 700.
  The number of Indians could not be ascertained with any degree of
  precision&mdash;not many were visible. And in the event of an
  attack upon the town and fort, it was a species of force which
  could have afforded no material advantage to the enemy.... That
  we were far superior to the enemy, that upon any ordinary
  principles of calculation we would have defeated them, the
  wounded and indignant feelings of every man there will
  testify.... I was informed by General Hull, the morning after the
  capitulation, that the British forces consisted of 1,800
  regulars, and that he surrendered to prevent the effusion of
  human blood. That he magnified their regular force nearly
  five-fold, there can be no doubt. Whether the philanthropic
  reason assigned by him is a sufficient justification for
  surrendering a fortified town, an army, and a territory, is for
  the government to determine. Confident I am, that had the courage
  and conduct of the general been equal to the spirit and zeal of
  the troops, the event would have been brilliant and successful as
  it is now disastrous and dishonorable." Hull's behaviour, then,
  can only be accounted for by the supposition that the boldness of
  his adversary's movements led him to believe he had to contend
  with far greater numbers; or, that having threatened to refuse
  quarter to the white man found fighting by the side of the
  <a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>Indian, he was apprehensive,
  in the event of defeat, that this threat would be visited with
  severe retaliation, particularly by the Indians, whose fury, in a
  successful assault, it might have been very difficult to
  restrain. To their honor, however, be it said, that although they
  took a few prisoners on the advance, the enemy sustained no loss
  of life beyond that caused by the British batteries; and in
  general orders, at Detroit, they were told, that in nothing could
  they testify more strongly their love to the king, their great
  father, than in following the dictates of honor and humanity by
  which they had hitherto been actuated.</p>

  <p>"The news of the surrender of Detroit," says the American
  historian, Brown, "was so unexpected, that it came like a clap of
  thunder to the ears of the American people. No one would believe
  the first report. The disastrous event blasted the prospects of
  the first campaign, and opened the northern and western frontiers
  of Ohio to savage incursions.</p>

  <p>"Previous to the surrender of Detroit, the governors of Ohio
  and Kentucky, in obedience to the directions of the war
  department, had detached powerful reinforcements to the aid of
  General Hull. Had he deferred the capitulation but a few days
  longer, his army, Detroit, and the Michigan territory, would have
  been saved.</p>

  <p>"The forces advancing to his support consisted of 2,000
  militia, under Brigadier-General Payne, and a battalion of
  mounted riflemen, under Colonel <a name="Page_237" id=
  "Page_237"></a>R.M. Johnson, from Kentucky; a brigade of Ohio
  militia, under the orders of Brigadier-General Tupper;<a name=
  "FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and nearly 1,000
  regulars, under the command of General Winchester. They had
  reached the St. Mary's River when the news of the capture of
  Detroit was received. But for the well-timed arrival of the above
  force a wide scene of flight and misery, of blood and desolation,
  must have ensued. Nearly half of the territory of Ohio must have
  been depopulated, or its inhabitants fallen victims to the
  scalping knife."</p>

  <p>"The chagrin felt at Washington," observes James in his
  Military Occurrences, "when news arrived of the total failure of
  this the first attempt at invasion, was in proportion to the
  sanguine hopes entertained of its success. To what a pitch of
  extravagance those hopes had been carried, cannot better appear
  than in two speeches delivered upon the floor of congress, in the
  summer of 1812. Dr. Eustis, the secretary at war of the United
  States, said: 'We can take the Canadas without soldiers; we have
  only to send officers into the provinces, and the people,
  disaffected towards their own government, will rally round our
  standard.' The honorable Henry Clay seconded his friend, thus:
  'It is absurd to suppose we shall not succeed in our enterprize
  against the enemy's provinces. We have the Canadas as much under
  our <a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>command as she (Great
  Britain) has the ocean; and the way to conquer her on the ocean
  is to drive her from the land. I am not for stopping at Quebec,
  or any where else; but I would take the whole continent from
  them, and ask them no favors. Her fleets cannot then rendezvous
  at Halifax, as now; and, having no place of resort in the north,
  cannot infest our coast as they have lately done. It is as easy
  to conquer them on the land, as their whole navy would conquer
  ours on the ocean. We must take the continent from them. <i>I
  wish never to see a peace till we do.</i> God has given us the
  power and the means: we are to blame if we do not use them. If we
  get the continent, she must allow us the freedom of the sea.'
  This is the gentleman who, afterwards, in the character of a
  commissioner&mdash;and it stands as a record of his unblushing
  apostacy&mdash;signed the treaty of peace."</p>

  <p>Tecumseh, who was slain the year following, headed a party of
  his warriors on this occasion, and in the rough sketch already
  mentioned, Major-General Brock remarked: "Among the Indians whom
  I found at Amherstburg, and who had arrived from distant parts of
  the country, there were some extraordinary characters. He who
  most attracted my attention was a Shawanee chief, Tecumseh, the
  brother of the prophet, who for the two last years has carried
  on, contrary to our remonstrances, an active war against the
  United States. A more sagacious or a more gallant war<a name=
  "Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>rior does not, I believe, exist. He
  was the admiration of every one who conversed with him. From a
  life of dissipation he has not only become in every respect
  abstemious, but he has likewise prevailed on all his nation, and
  many of the other tribes, to follow his example." Previously to
  crossing over to Detroit, Major-General Brock inquired of
  Tecumseh what sort of a country he should have to pass through in
  the event of his proceeding further. Tecumseh, taking a roll of
  elm bark, and extending it on the ground, drew forth his scalping
  knife, and with the point presently edged upon the back a plan of
  the country, its hills, woods, rivers, morasses, and
  roads&mdash;a plan which, if not as neat, was fully as
  intelligible as if a surveyor had prepared it. Pleased with this
  unexpected talent in Tecumseh, with his defeat of the Americans
  near Brownstown, and with his having, by his characteristic
  boldness, induced the Indians, not of his own tribe, to cross the
  river prior to the embarkation of the white troops, Major-General
  Brock, soon after Detroit was surrendered, took off his sash and
  publicly placed it round the body of the chief. Tecumseh received
  the honor with evident gratification, but was the next day seen
  without the sash. The British general, fearing that something had
  displeased the Indian, sent his interpreter for an explanation.
  Tecumseh told him, that not wishing to wear such a mark of
  distinction when an older, and, as he said, an abler warrior than
  himself was present, he <a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>had
  transferred the sash to the Wyandot chief, Roundhead.<a name=
  "FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

  <p>The unfortunate General Hull, on his return to the United
  States, was tried by a court martial and condemned to death; but
  the sentence was remitted by the president, in consideration of
  his age and services during the war of independence.<a name=
  "FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> His name was,
  however, struck off the rolls of the army. His son, and
  aide-de-camp at Detroit, Captain Hull, was killed in July, 1814,
  in the hard-fought battle near the Falls of Niagara.</p>

  <p>Major-General Brock's services throughout this short campaign,
  closed by an achievement which his energy and decision crowned
  with such unqualified success, were highly appreciated by the
  government at home, and were immediately rewarded with the order
  of the bath, which was then confined to one degree of knighthood
  only. He was gazetted to this mark of his country's approbation,
  so gratifying to the feelings of a soldier, on the 10th of
  October; but he lived not long enough to learn that he had
  obtained so honorable a distinction, the knowledge of which would
  have cheered him in his last moments. Singularly enough his
  dispatches, accompanied by the colours of the U.S. 4th regiment,
  reached London early on the morning of the 6th of October, the
  anniversary of his birth. His brother William, who was residing
  in the vicinity, was asked by his <a name="Page_241" id=
  "Page_241"></a>wife why the park and tower guns were saluting.
  "For Isaac, of course," he replied; "do you not know that this is
  his birth-day?" And when he came to town he learnt, with emotions
  which may be easily conceived, that what he had just said in jest
  was true in reality; little thinking, however, that all his
  dreams, all his anticipations of a beloved brother's increasing
  fame and prosperity would that day week, one short week, be
  entombed</p>

  <p>In one of his letters to his brothers, (page <a href=
  '#Page_63'>63</a>,) Major-General Brock said that he had visited
  Detroit, the neighbourhood of which was a delightful country, far
  exceeding any thing he had seen on that continent, and a cursory
  description of it, as it appeared in 1812, may prove
  interesting.</p>

  <p>The Detroit river, which connects Lake St. Clair and Lake
  Erie, extends from about latitude 41&deg; 48' to 42&deg; 18'
  north, and divides that part of Canada from the United States.
  Possessing a salubrious climate, a productive soil, and a water
  communication with the upper and lower lakes and the river St.
  Lawrence, we can scarcely conceive any thing more favorable than
  the geographical position of the adjacent country. Michigan
  afforded a rich field for "fowling" and fishing, and its forests
  were plentifully supplied with various kinds of game. It was the
  opinion of a former governor of Upper Canada, Simcoe, that
  <a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>the peninsula of that
  province formed by Lakes Huron, St. Clair, Erie, Ontario, Rice,
  and Simcoe, would alone furnish a surplus of wheat sufficient for
  the wants of Great Britain. The banks of the Detroit were in many
  places thickly peopled and in a fair state of cultivation. The
  inhabitants on the Canadian side were chiefly of French origin,
  who began to occupy the country when Canada was still under the
  dominion of France. They still retained that urbanity of manners
  which distinguishes them from the peasantry of most countries.
  Further back, the country was settled principally by Americans,
  partial to the United States. Three or four years after the war,
  the houses were so numerous and so close together upon the banks
  of the Detroit, that there was an appearance of a succession of
  villages for more than ten miles. The farms were very narrow in
  front, extending a long way back, and were allotted in this
  awkward and inconvenient form, that their respective occupants
  might be able to render each other assistance when attacked by
  the Indians, who were at one time very numerous and troublesome
  in this vicinity.</p>

  <p>The banks of the river Detroit are the Eden of Upper Canada,
  in so far as regards the production of fruit. Apples, pears,
  plums, peaches, grapes, and nectarines, attain the highest degree
  of perfection, and exceed in size, beauty, and flavour, those
  raised in any other part of the province. Cider abounds at the
  table of the meanest peasant, <a name="Page_243" id=
  "Page_243"></a>and there is scarcely a farm that has not a
  fruitful orchard attached to it. This fineness of the fruit is
  one consequence of the amelioration of climate, which takes place
  in the vicinity of the Detroit river and Lake St. Clair. The
  seasons there are much milder and more serene than they are a few
  hundred miles below, and the weather is likewise drier and less
  variable. Comparatively little snow falls during the winter,
  although the cold is often sufficiently intense to freeze over
  the Detroit river so strongly, that persons, horses, and even
  loaded sleighs, cross it with ease and safety. In summer, the
  country presents a forest of blossoms, which exhale the most
  delicious odours; a cloud seldom obscures the sky; while the
  lakes and rivers, which extend in every direction, communicate a
  reviving freshness to the air, and moderate the warmth of a
  dazzling sun; and the clearness and elasticity of the atmosphere
  render it equally healthy and exhilarating.<a name=
  "FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

  <p>The fort of Detroit was originally constructed to overawe the
  neighbouring Indian nations, and its military importance as the
  key of the upper lakes appears to have been well known to them.
  But, neither possessing battering cannon nor understanding the
  art of attacking fortified places, they could only reduce them by
  stratagem or famine, and Detroit could always be supplied with
  provisions by water. In the year 1763, the Indian chief, Pontiac,
  whose name has already appeared, <a name="Page_244" id=
  "Page_244"></a>(page <a href='#Page_164'>164</a>), formed a
  powerful confederacy of the different tribes, for the purpose of
  revenging their past wrongs and of preventing their total
  extirpation, which they were erroneously led to believe was
  contemplated. In a sudden, general, and simultaneous irruption on
  the British frontier, they obtained possession, chiefly by
  stratagem, of Michilimakinack,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id=
  "FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class=
  "fnanchor">[77]</a> Presqu'&icirc;le, and several smaller posts;
  but there still remained three fortresses formidable alike by
  their strength and position, which it was necessary the Indians
  should subdue before they could reap any permanent advantage from
  their successes. These were Detroit, Niagara, and Pittsburg; and
  the first and last, although so remote from each other, were
  invested almost at the same moment. The consummate address, which
  the Indians displayed in this alarming war, was supported by a
  proportionate degree of courage, determination, and perseverance;
  nor ever did they approve themselves a more stubborn and
  formidable enemy than in this final stand against the
  encroachments of European dominion and civilization in North
  America. General Amherst, sensible of the danger, sent immediate
  succours to those two western garrisons, and thus prevented
  <a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>their fall. Captain Dalzell,
  after conducting, in July, a strong reinforcement to Detroit, was
  induced to think that he could surprise the Indian force encamped
  about three miles from the fort, and he sat out at night with 270
  men, adopting the most judicious precautions for the secrecy and
  good order of his march. But the Indians, apprized of his design,
  were prepared to defeat it, and every step from the fort only
  conducted the English troops further into the jaws of
  destruction. Their advance was suddenly arrested by a sharp fire
  on their front, which was presently followed by a similar
  discharge on their rear, and then succeeded by destructive
  vollies from every side. In the darkness neither the position nor
  the numbers of the Indians could be ascertained. Dalzell was
  slain early, and his whole detachment was on the brink of
  irretrievable confusion and ruin when Captain Grant, the next in
  command, perceiving that a retreat, now the only resource, could
  only be accomplished by a resolute attack, promptly rallied the
  survivors, who, steadily obeying his orders, charged the Indians
  with so much spirit and success as to repulse them on all sides
  to some distance. Having thus extricated themselves from
  immediate peril, the British hastily regained the shelter of the
  fort, with the loss of 70 killed and 40 wounded; and the Indians,
  unable to reduce the fort by a regular siege, and pausing long
  enough to ascertain that the garrison was completely on its guard
  against stratagem and sur<a name="Page_246" id=
  "Page_246"></a>prise, broke up their camp and abandoned the
  vicinity of Detroit.</p>

  <p>The Indians, thus grievously disappointed in their designs on
  Detroit and Pittsburg, now closely beleaguered Niagara, which
  they justly considered as not less important. They hoped to
  reduce it by famine, and on the 14th of September, surrounding a
  convoy of provisions which had nearly reached its destination,
  they succeeded in making it their prey by a sudden attack, in
  which 70 of the British soldiers were slain. Shortly after, as a
  schooner was crossing Lake Erie with supplies for Detroit, she
  was attacked by a numerous fleet of canoes, in which were nearly
  400 Indians. But this attempt was less successful, and, after a
  warm engagement, the Indian flotilla was repulsed with
  considerable loss, as, in a conflict with an armed vessel, they
  were exposed to the same disadvantages which attended their
  operations against fortified places. Niagara having at length
  been powerfully reinforced and well supplied, the Indians
  abandoned all hope of reducing it, and thenceforth confined
  themselves to their wonted predatory hostility. In the spring and
  summer of the following year, the British troops attacked them
  with such vigour and success, that they were compelled to
  propose, in Indian phrase, to <i>bury the hatchet</i>; and in
  September a treaty of peace was concluded, the conditions of
  which were dictated by the English.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id=

      of the French inhabitants, beheld the massacre from an

      He describes it as follows: "I beheld, in shapes the foulest
      and most terrible, the ferocious triumphs of barbarian
      conquerors. The dead were scalped and mangled; the dying were
      writhing and shrieking under the insatiated knife and
      tomahawk, and from the bodies of some, ripped open, their
      butchers were drinking the blood scooped up in the hollows of

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Head Quarters, Detroit, Aug. 16, 1812.</p>

    <p>I hasten to apprize your excellency of the capture of this
    very important post: 2,500 troops have this day surrendered
    prisoners of war, and about 25 pieces of ordnance have been
    taken without the sacrifice of a drop of British blood. I had
    not more than 700 troops, including militia, and about 600
    Indians, to accomplish this service. When I detail my good
    fortune, your excellency will be astonished. I have been
    admirably supported by Colonel Proctor, the whole of my staff,
    and I may justly say, every individual under my command.</p>

    "FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href=
    "#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

    <p>I have had the honor of informing your excellency, that the
    enemy effected his passage across <a name="Page_248" id=
    "Page_248"></a>the Detroit river, on the 12th ultimo, without
    opposition; and that, after establishing himself at Sandwich,
    he had ravaged the country as far as the Moravian town. Some
    skirmishes occurred between the troops under Lieut.-Colonel St.
    George and the enemy, upon the river Canard, which uniformly
    terminated in his being repulsed with loss. I judged it proper
    to detach a force down the river Thames, capable of acting in
    conjunction with the garrison of Amherstburg offensively, but
    Captain Chambers, whom I had appointed to direct this
    detachment, experienced difficulties that frustrated my
    intentions. The intelligence received from that quarter
    admitting of no delay, Colonel Proctor was directed to assume
    the command, and his force was soon after increased with 60
    rank and file of the 41st regiment.</p>

    <p>In the mean time, the most strenuous measures were adopted
    to counteract the machinations of the evil-disposed, and I soon
    experienced the gratification of receiving voluntary offers of
    service from that portion of the embodied militia the most
    easily collected. In the attainment of this important point,
    gentlemen of the first character and influence shewed an
    example highly creditable to them; and I cannot, on this
    occasion, avoid mentioning the essential assistance I derived
    from John M'Donell, Esq., his majesty's attorney-general, who,
    from the beginning of the war, has honored me with his services
    as my provincial aide-de-camp. A sufficiency of boats being
    collected at <a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>Long Point
    for the conveyance of 300 men, the embarkation took place on
    the 8th instant, and in five days we arrived in safety at
    Amherstburg.</p>

    <p>I found that the judicious arrangements which had been
    adopted immediately upon the arrival of Colonel Proctor, had
    compelled the enemy to retreat, and take shelter under the guns
    of his fort: that officer commenced operations by sending
    strong detachments across the river, with a view of cutting off
    the enemy's communication with his reserve. This produced two
    smart skirmishes on the 5th and 9th instant, in which the
    enemy's loss was considerable, whilst ours amounted to 3 killed
    and 13 wounded; amongst the latter, I have particularly to
    regret Captain Muir and Lieutenant Sutherland, of the 41st
    regiment; the former an officer of great experience, and both
    ardent in his majesty's service. Batteries had likewise been
    commenced opposite Fort Detroit, for one 18-pounder, two 12,
    and two 5&frac12;-inch mortars, all of which opened on the
    evening of the 15th; (having previously summoned
    Brigadier-General Hull to surrender;) and although opposed by a
    well-directed fire from seven 24-pounders, such was their
    construction, under the able direction of Captain Dixon, of the
    Royal Engineers, that no injury was sustained from its
    effect.</p>

    <p>The force at my disposal being collected in the course of
    the 15th, in the neighbourhood of Sandwich, the embarkation
    took place a little after daylight on the following morning;
    and by the <a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>able
    arrangements of Lieutenant Dewar, of the
    quartermaster-general's department, the whole was in a short
    time landed without the smallest confusion at Spring Well, a
    good position, three miles west of Detroit. The Indians, who
    had in the mean time effected their landing two miles below,
    moved forward and occupied the woods, about a mile and a half
    on our left.</p>

    <p>The force, which I instantly directed to march against the
    enemy, consisted of 30 artillery, 250 41st regiment, 50 royal
    Newfoundland regiment, 400 militia, and about 600 Indians, to
    which were attached three 6-pounders and two 3-pounders. The
    services of Lieutenant Troughton, commanding the royal
    artillery, an active and intelligent officer, being required in
    the field, the direction of the batteries was entrusted to
    Captain Hall and the marine department, and I cannot withhold
    my entire approbation of their conduct on this occasion.</p>

    <p>I crossed the river, with an intention of waiting in a
    strong position the effect of our force upon the enemy's camp,
    and in the hope of compelling him to meet us in the field; but
    receiving information upon landing, that Colonel M'Arthur, an
    officer of high reputation, had left the garrison three days
    before with a detachment of 500 men, and hearing, soon
    afterwards, that his cavalry had been seen that morning three
    miles in our rear, I decided on an immediate attack.
    Accordingly, the troops advanced to within one mile of the
    fort, and having ascertained that the enemy had taken <a name=
    "Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>little or no precaution towards
    the land side, I resolved on an assault, whilst the Indians
    penetrated his camp. Brigadier-General Hull, however, prevented
    this movement, by proposing a cessation of hostilities, for the
    purpose of preparing terms of capitulation. Lieut.-Colonel J.
    M'cDonell and Captain Glegg were accordingly deputed by me on
    this mission, and returned within an hour with the conditions,
    which I have the honor herewith to transmit. Certain
    considerations afterwards induced me to agree to the two
    supplementary articles.</p>

    <p>The force thus surrendered to his majesty's arms cannot be
    estimated at less than 2,500 men. In this estimate, Colonel
    M'cArthur's detachment is included, as he surrendered,
    agreeably to the terms of capitulation, in the course of the
    evening, with the exception of 200 men, whom he left escorting
    a valuable convoy at some little distance in his rear; but
    there can be no doubt the officer commanding will consider
    himself equally bound by the capitulation.</p>

    <p>The enemy's aggregate force was divided into two troops of
    cavalry; one company of artillery, regulars; the 4th United
    States' regiment; detachments of the 1st and 3d United States'
    regiments, volunteers; three regiments of the Ohio militia; one
    regiment of the Michigan territory.</p>

    <p>Thirty-three pieces of brass and iron ordnance have already
    been secured.</p>

    <p>When this contest commenced, many of the <a name="Page_252"
    id="Page_252"></a>Indian nations were engaged in active warfare
    with the United States, notwithstanding the constant endeavours
    of this government to dissuade them from it. Some of the
    principal chiefs happened to be at Amherstburg, trying to
    procure a supply of arms and ammunition, which for years had
    been withheld, agreeably to the instructions received from Sir
    James Craig, and since repeated by your excellency.</p>

    <p>From that moment they took a most active part, and appeared
    foremost on every occasion; they were led yesterday by Colonel
    Elliott and Captain M'Kee, and nothing could exceed their order
    and steadiness. A few prisoners were taken by them during the
    advance, whom they treated with every humanity; and it affords
    me much pleasure in assuring your excellency, that such was
    their forbearance and attention to what was required of them,
    that the enemy sustained no other loss in men than what was
    occasioned by the fire of our batteries.</p>

    <p>The high sense I entertain of the abilities and judgment of
    Lieut-Colonel Myers, induced me to appoint him to the important
    command at Niagara; it was with reluctance I deprived myself of
    his assistance, but I had no other expedient; his duties, as
    head of the quartermaster-general's department, were performed
    to my satisfaction by Lieut.-Colonel Nichol,
    quartermaster-general of the militia.</p>

    <p>Captain Glegg, my aide-de-camp, will have the <a name=
    "Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>honor of delivering this dispatch
    to your excellency; he is charged with the colours taken at the
    capture of Fort Detroit, and those of the 4th United States'
    regiment.</p>

    <p>Captain Glegg is capable of giving your excellency every
    information respecting the state of this province, and I shall
    esteem myself highly indebted to your excellency, to afford him
    that protection to which his merit and length of service give
    him a powerful claim.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
    "FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=
    "fnanchor">[81]</a> I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
    proclamation which I issued immediately on taking possession of
    this country.</p>

    <p>I should have mentioned in the body of my dispatch, the
    capture of the Adams; she is a fine vessel, and recently
    repaired, but without arms.</p>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Head Quarters, Montreal, Aug. 30, 1812.</p>

    <p>I received on the 25th, whilst at St. John's, your dispatch,
    by express from Detroit, of the 16th instant. I do most
    sincerely congratulate you upon the complete success which has
    attended your measures for the preservation of Amherstburg. The
    surrender of Detroit, the capture of General Hull's army with
    so large a proportion of ordnance, are circumstances of high
    importance to our country, and which have evinced your talents
    as an officer in command, and reflect honor upon <a name=
    "Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>you, and upon Lieut.-Colonel St.
    George and Colonel Proctor.</p>

    <p>I propose sending an aide-de-camp to England with your short
    dispatch, together with such details as I am in possession of,
    respecting Brigadier-General Hull's previous invasion of Upper
    Canada and of his foiled attempts to invest Amherstburg; but I
    shall delay his departure from hence until the 1st of
    September, in hopes of obtaining from you before that time
    further particulars of the operations which led to General
    Hull's disgrace.</p>

    <p>Well aware of the difficulties you have surmounted Tor the
    preservation of your government entire, I shall endeavour to do
    justice to your merit in my report to his majesty's minister
    upon the success which has crowned your energy and zeal.</p>

    <p>A warrant, giving to you more extensive power over the
    sentence of such general courts martial as you may be called on
    to assemble, was signed by me ten days since, and has I hope
    reached you.</p>

    <p>I am in hourly expectation of receiving from General
    Dearborn intelligence respecting the reception of the proposed
    suspension of hostilities, in consequence of the revocation of
    the orders in council, which are the plea for war in the
    American cabinet; and also whether Mr. Baker has been allowed
    to assume, <i>pro tempore</i>, the character of a charg&eacute;
    d'affaires at Washington, where Mr. Foster had left him in a
    demi-official capacity. I consider the arrangement entered into
    by General <a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>Dearborn with
    Colonel Baynes, requiring the confirmation of the president, to
    establish its sacredness.</p>

    <p>The king's government having most unequivocally expressed to
    me their desire to preserve peace with the United States, that
    they might, uninterrupted, pursue, with the whole disposable
    force of the country, the great interest committed in Europe, I
    have endeavoured to be instrumental in the accomplishment of
    their views; but I consider it most fortunate to have been
    enabled to do so without interfering with your operations on
    the Detroit.</p>

    <p>I have sent you men, money, and stores of every kind.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Head Quarters, Montreal, Aug. 31, 1812.</p>

    <p>I had scarcely closed the letters I addressed to you
    yesterday, when an aide-de-camp from Major-General Dearborn
    made his appearance, and delivered to me the dispatch herewith
    transmitted. It will expose to your view the disposition of the
    president of the United States on the provisional measure
    temporarily agreed upon between the American commander-in-chief
    and myself, in consequence of an earnest desire not to widen
    the breach existing between the two countries, the revocation
    of the orders in council having removed the plea used in
    congress for a declaration of war against Great Britain.</p>

    <p>I am much disappointed that the particulars of <a name=
    "Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>the surrender of Detroit have not
    as yet reached me, particularly as my aide-de-camp, Captain
    Coore, is to leave Montreal this evening for Quebec, where a
    ship of war is on the point of sailing for Halifax, from whence
    I expect the admiral will give him a conveyance for
    England.</p>

    <p>Being unacquainted with the conditions attached to the
    surrender of Brigadier-General Hull's army, and giving scope to
    your expression of prisoners of war, I have made arrangements
    for increasing their security against any attempt to rescue
    them, by ordering Captain Gray to proceed with two flank
    companies to Prescot.</p>
  </div>

  <p>[The dispatch from General Dearborn, dated Greenbush, August
  26, was to announce the discontinuance of the temporary armistice
  agreed to between him and Colonel Baynes, in four days after the
  receipt of the communication at the frontier posts in Canada. The
  American general added: "If a suspension of offensive operations
  shall have been mutually consented to between General Hull and
  the commanding officer of the British forces at and near Detroit,
  as proposed, they will respectively be authorized, at the
  expiration of four days subsequent to their receiving copies of
  this communication, to consider themselves released from any
  agreement thus entered into."]</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>As we have already commented on Sir George Prevost's
  management of the war, and shall have occasionally to do so
  again, we gladly give him credit for the very handsome manner in
  which he spoke of Major-General Brock, in his dispatch to Earl
  Bathurst, one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state,
  announcing the surrender of Detroit, and dated Montreal, 26th
  August, 1812.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"It was under these circumstances at this critical period,
    and when the enemy were beginning to consult their security by
    entrenching themselves, <a name="Page_257" id=
    "Page_257"></a>that General Brock entered Amherstburg with a
    reinforcement, which he was fortunately enabled to do on the
    13th instant, without the smallest molestation, in consequence
    of our decided naval superiority on the lakes. To his active
    and intelligent mind, the advantages which his enemy's
    situation afforded him over them, even with his very inferior
    force, became immediately apparent; and that he has not failed
    most effectually to avail himself of those favorable
    circumstances, your lordship will, I trust, be satisfied, from
    the letter which I have the honor of transmitting.</p>

    <p>"Having thus brought to your lordship's view the different
    circumstances which have led to the successful termination of
    the campaign on the western frontier of Upper Canada, I cannot
    withhold from Major-General Brock the tribute of applause so
    justly due to him for his distinguished conduct on this
    occasion; or omit to recommend him, through your lordship, to
    the favorable consideration of his royal highness the prince
    regent, for the great ability and judgment with which he
    planned, and the promptitude, energy, and fortitude with which
    he has effected, the preservation of Upper Canada, with the
    sacrifice of so little British blood in accomplishing so
    important a service.</p>

    <p>"My aide-de-camp, Captain Coore, will have the honor of
    delivering to your lordship this dispatch; and as he is well
    qualified to give your lordship information respecting the
    military resources of <a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>this
    command, I shall beg leave to refer your lordship to him for
    farther particulars."</p>
  </div>

  <p>At the same time, truth compels us to add, that Sir George
  Prevost took credit to himself, to which he was not entitled,
  when he wrote to Lord Bathurst: "General Brock, relying upon the
  strong assurances I had given him of a reinforcement as prompt
  and as effectual as the circumstances by which I was placed by
  this new war would permit me to send, adopted the most vigorous
  measures for the safety of that part of the frontier which had
  been attacked." And again: "The certainty of the expected
  reinforcements, and the weakness of the enemy on the Niagara
  frontier, had in the mean time induced General Brock," &amp;c.
  The last dispatch which, we believe, Major-General Brock had
  received from Sir George Prevost, when on the 6th of August he
  left York for Detroit, was dated the 10th and received on the
  29th July; and in that dispatch (see page <a href=
  '#Page_178'>178</a>) no reinforcements were promised, and indeed
  offensive operations were deprecated. The first reinforcement
  which left Lower for Upper Canada, appears to have consisted of
  about 100 men of the Newfoundland regiment and 50 of the
  Veterans, which left Quebec on the 30th of July for Kingston, to
  strengthen that post; and the adjutant-general, on the 1st of
  August, (page <a href='#Page_211'>211</a>), wrote that Sir George
  Prevost regretted extremely his inability to render Major-General
  Brock more efficient aid. It was only on the 2d of August
  <a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>that Sir George Prevost
  promised an additional reinforcement of four companies of the
  49th regiment, (page <a href='#Page_215'>215</a>,) and on the
  12th of the same month the remainder of the regiment (page
  <a href='#Page_218'>218</a>). Mr. Powell confirms this view of
  the subject in his admirable letter, page <a href=
  '#Page_261'>261</a>. It will be seen in the sequel that, on the
  13th of August, the adjutant-general wrote that he had strongly
  urged Sir George Prevost to send further reinforcements, as he
  was sure they could be spared. As to the remark relative to the
  weakness of the enemy on the Niagara frontier, we shall only
  mention that Major-General Brock states, in a MS. before us, that
  it was the strong American force on that frontier which compelled
  him to take with him to Detroit only half of the militia, who
  volunteered.</p>

    <p>I cannot persuade myself to offer my hearty congratulations
    through the medium of a third person, and hope you will believe
    that no one sympathizes more cordially than myself in your
    feelings on the late happy event. I shall never again regret
    little disappointments, when I consider to what they may lead:
    had your early representations been attended to and produced
    their proper effect, you would probably not have to boast of
    the most brilliant success, with the most inadequate means,
    which history records. There is something so fabulous in the
    report of a handful of troops, supported by a few raw militia,
    leaving their strong post to invade an enemy of double <a name=
    "Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>numbers in his own fortress, and
    making them all prisoners without the loss of a man, that,
    although your report may be sanctioned by Sir George Prevost,
    it seems to me that the people of England will be incredulous
    until they see the exterminating boaster a prisoner in London.
    We find in a cover by General Sheaffe, that the first report of
    the cannon taken was one-third short of the real number. I
    shall hardly sleep until I have the satisfaction of hearing
    particulars of the wonderful excursion, for it must not be
    called a campaign. The <i>veni, vidi, vici</i>, is again the
    faithful report. Your good fortune in one instance is singular,
    for if your zeal had been thwarted by such adverse winds as
    frequently occur on the lake, the armistice might have
    intercepted your career. That it did not I heartily thank God,
    and pray that nothing may occur to damp the entire satisfaction
    of yourself and family in the glory so well earned. I am
    impatient to hear from Colonel M'Donell, but have no doubt that
    he justified your warmest expectations in every trial. May I
    beg to be presented to Glegg, and that you, Sir, will believe
    me, &amp;c.</p>

  the 49th foot from the 25th May, 1768, to the period of his
  death, in February, 1820, or nearly fifty-two years!
  Major-General Brock held this gallant veteran in high estimation,
  having received from him much attention and kindness, which were
  continued to some of his relatives after his fall, and it will be
  seen that the feeling was mutual. Although General Maitland was
  so many years colonel of the 49th, yet we find that the Marquis
  of Drogheda held a similar appointment for a longer period, being
  colonel of the 18th Hussars from the 3d August, 1762, to October,
  1821, when that regiment was disbanded, or above fifty-nine
  years!</p>

    <p>Yesterday being mail day for America, I dispatched my usual
    monthly letter to the regiment, <a name="Page_264" id=
    "Page_264"></a>and in which, as I always do, I desired to be
    remembered to you with my best and warmest wishes for your
    health, happiness, and success. I had not then heard, but did a
    few hours after, of your <i>glorious victory</i> over our most
    unnatural enemies, (such an one as can hardly be equalled in
    the annals of history,) that of not only beating, but taking
    prisoners, more than double your numbers; and now that you have
    conquered them in the field, I trust that their wrong-headed
    government will be brought to reason and peace, for it will
    prove to them, if they persevere, that they will be forced to
    it, and terms dictated to them. Therefore allow me, Sir, with
    the warmest feelings of an old friend to congratulate you, as I
    do the public, on the essential service you have done the
    country on the present occasion; as I do my friend, your
    aide-de-camp, Captain Glegg, as far as the sphere of his duty
    could assist in the great work; and <i>I glory to say you are
    both 49-thers</i>. I could write sheets on the subject, but,
    not to take up your valuable time longer than I have done to
    express my pleasure and feelings, I will stop by adding the
    sincere congratulations of all related to me here as well as
    elsewhere. But I cannot help now observing how prophetic I was
    in what I wrote to Colonel Vincent yesterday concerning you,
    which was, <i>that if you mere properly supported, I thought
    the enemy would never cross the line of your command</i>, a
    proof of which I had a few hours afterwards.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>When you see any of our
    friends of the 49th, pray remember me in the kindest manner to
    them, and I am sure they will thank you that they are safe and

    so severe a climate. And now I will only add my warmest wishes
    for your health and happiness, and that the same good fortune
    that has hitherto attended you may continue; and I beg that you
    will be so good as to convey the same to my friend, your

    achievement at my old quarter, Detroit.</p>

    <p>To evince to you how much I regard you, and how much I have

    then, the very sincere congratulations of an old friend on this
    occasion, and be assured of the happiness it gives me, as well
    as Mrs. Burnet, who is with me, and sends her love to you.</p>

    <p>LAKE ONTARIO, September 3, 1812.</p>

    <p>You will have heard of the complete success which attended
    the efforts I directed against Detroit. I have received so many
    letters from people whose opinion I value, expressive of their
    admiration of the exploit, that I begin to attach to it more
    importance than I was at first inclined. Should the affair be
    viewed in England in the light it is here, I cannot fail of
    meeting reward, and escaping the horror of being placed high on
    a shelf, never to be taken down.</p>

    <p>Some say that nothing could be more desperate than the
    measure; but I answer, that the state of the province admitted
    of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the
    letters my antagonist addressed to the secretary at war, and
    also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to
    their friends. Confidence in the general was gone, and evident
    despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond
    expectation. I crossed the river, contrary to the opinion of
    Colonel Proctor,&mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c.; it is, therefore, no
    wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what, in
    justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a
    cool calculation of the <i>pours</i> and <i>contres</i>.</p>

    <p>They say that the value of the articles captured will amount
    to 30 or &pound;40,000; in that case, my proportion will be
    something considerable. If it <a name="Page_268" id=
    "Page_268"></a>enable me to contribute to your comfort and
    happiness, I shall esteem it my highest reward. When I returned
    Heaven thanks for my amazing success, I thought of you all; you
    appeared to me happy&mdash;your late sorrows forgotten; and I
    felt as if you acknowledged that the many benefits, which for a
    series of years I received from you, were not unworthily
    bestowed. Let me know, my dearest brothers, that you are all
    again united. The want of union was nearly losing this province
    without even a struggle, and be assured it operates in the same
    degree in regard to families.</p>

    <p>A cessation of hostilities has taken place along this
    frontier. Should peace follow, the measure will be well; if
    hostilities recommence, nothing could be more unfortunate than
    this pause. I cannot give you freely an account of my
    situation&mdash;it is, however, of late much improved. The
    militia have been inspired, by the recent success, with
    confidence&mdash;the disaffected are silenced. The 49th have
    come to my aid, besides other troops. I shall see Vincent, I
    hope, this evening at Kingston. He is appointed to the command
    of that post&mdash;a most important one. I have withdrawn
    Plenderleath from Niagara to assist him. P&mdash;&mdash; is
    sitting opposite to me, and desires to be remembered. James
    Brock is likewise at Kingston. I believe he considers it more
    his interest to remain with the 49th than to act as my private
    secretary; indeed, the salary is a mere pittance. Poor Leggatt
    is dead, and has left his family in <a name="Page_269" id=
    "Page_269"></a>the most distressing circumstances. His wife
    died last year.</p>

    <p>Major Smelt and Captain Brown have sent me your letters, for
    which I thank you. Let Richard Potenger be assured that his
    letter afforded me the highest gratification. I trust in Heaven
    that the whole of his thoughts will be directed to study, and
    to qualify himself for the holy profession he has chosen.
    Ignorance is despised in most men, but more particularly in the
    clergyman educated at one of the universities, who must have
    neglected so many opportunities of acquiring knowledge.</p>

    <p>I received the other day a long letter from Sir Thomas
    Saumarez, from Halifax. I regret the death of the two Harry
    Brocks.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id=
    "FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class=
    "fnanchor">[84]</a> I have likewise been particularly
    unfortunate in the loss of two valuable military friends. I
    begin to be too old to form new friendships, and those of my
    youth are dropping off fast.</p>

    <p>General Sheaffe has lately been sent to me. There never was
    an individual so miserably off for the necessary assistance.
    Sir George Prevost has kindly hearkened to my remonstrances,
    and in some measure supplied the deficiency. The 41st is an
    uncommonly fine regiment, but, with few exceptions, badly
    officered. You mention John Tupper<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id=
    "FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class=
    "fnanchor">[85]</a> in a manner as to leave hope that he may
    <a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>still be living. God grant
    it! He is a great favorite of mine, and I should lament any
    disaster happening to him. Perhaps Glegg may be sent home by
    Sir George, and in that case I hope he will allow you to see
    the colours taken from the 4th U.S. regiment. The generality of
    the English will esteem them very little: nothing is prized
    that is not acquired with blood.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>DETROIT, August 25, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have just been informed by Colonel Proctor that he intends
    sending an express to-morrow to Fort George, which gives me an
    opportunity to forward a few printed copies of your
    proclamation, and to inform you that in order to carry it into
    effect, it has been found absolutely necessary to organize the
    civil government. Under existing circumstances, I have advised
    Colonel Proctor to <a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>assume
    the administration until your pleasure is known, to which he
    has agreed, and the necessary arrangements consequent thereto
    have been adopted and promulgated. In Judge Woodward, who has
    been appointed secretary <i>pro tem</i>, he will find an able
    coadjutor; and as your object undoubtedly was to tranquillize
    the public mind and to give the inhabitants a proof of the
    moderation and benevolence of his majesty's government, as well
    as to ensure the due administration of the laws, I do not think
    a more judicious choice could have been made. In all the
    discussions which took place on this subject, Colonel Proctor
    did me the honor to consult me; and I have no hesitation in
    saying, that I urged him to the step he has taken, of which I
    hope you will, as it is only temporary, approve. We have had
    much difficulty in collecting the public cattle and horses, and
    have suffered greatly from the predatory spirit of the Indians;
    indeed, their conduct has been infamous. There is hardly a
    house on either side of the river that has not been robbed by
    them; they have taken away the greater part of the captured
    horses and cattle, and without our being able to prevent it. It
    has not been in my power as yet to send a statement of all that
    we have captured, as the property is so scattered, but I hope
    to finish this week. We got upwards of &pound;1,200 in money,
    and have sent down a hundred packs worth, I suppose
    &pound;1,500 more. I have reason to think the captured property
    will not be much under &pound;40,000.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>We have still 350
    prisoners to ship off, but I hope to get rid of them in a few
    days. Public confidence seems to be partially restored;
    business is again going on, and I hope that the country will
    become perfectly quiet.</p>

    <p>It is impossible for me to say when I shall get done here. I
    hope, however, it will not be long. I regret that we are not
    able to send you complete returns of every thing; but the
    captured property is in so many different places, and so
    scattered, that it cannot be done.</p>

  <p><i>Extract from a Canadian Newspaper.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, September 12.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday evening the inhabitants of this city were
    gratified with an exhibition equally novel and interesting.</p>

    <p>That General Hull should have entered into our city so soon,
    at the head of his troops, rather exceeded our expectations. We
    were, however, very happy to see him, and received him with all
    the honors due to his high rank and importance as a public
    character. The following particulars, relative to his journey
    and reception at Montreal, may not be uninteresting to our
    readers:</p>

    <p>It appears that General Hull and suite, accompanied by about
    25 officers and 350 soldiers, left Kingston, under an escort of
    130 men, commanded by Major Heathcote, of the Newfoundland
    regiment. At Cornwall, the escort was met by Captain Gray, of
    the quartermaster-general's department, who took charge of the
    prisoners of war, and from thence proceeded with them to La
    Chine, where they arrived about two o'clock on Sunday
    afternoon. At La Chine, Captains Richardson and Ogilvie, with
    their companies of Montreal militia, and a company of the
    king's <a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>from Lower Chine,
    commanded by Captain Blackmore, formed the escort till they
    were met by Colonel Auldjo, with the remainder of the flank
    companies of the militia, upon which Captain Blackmore's
    company fell out and presented arms as the general and line
    passed, and then returned to La Chine, leaving the prisoners of
    war to be guarded by the militia alone. The line of march then
    proceeded to the town in the following order, viz:</p>

    <p>1. Band of the king's regiment.</p>

    <p>2. The first division of the escort.</p>

    <p>3. General Hull in a carriage, accompanied by Captain Gray.
    Captain Hull and Major Shekleton followed in the second, and
    some wounded officers occupied four others.</p>

    <p>4. The American officers.</p>

    <p>5. The non-commissioned officers and soldiers.</p>

    <p>6. The second division of the escort.</p>

    <p>It unfortunately proved rather late in the evening for the
    vast concourse of spectators assembled to experience that
    gratification they so anxiously looked for. This inconvenience
    was, however, in a great measure remedied by the illuminations
    of the streets through which the line of march passed. When
    they arrived at the general's house, the general was conducted
    in, and presented to his excellency Sir George Prevost, and was
    received with the greatest politeness, and invited to take up
    his residence there during his stay at Montreal. The other
    officers were accommodated at Holmes' hotel, and the soldiers
    lodged in the Quebec barracks. The general appears to be about
    sixty years of age, and is a good looking man, and we are
    informed by those who have had frequent opportunities of
    conversing with him, that he is a man of general information.
    He is communicative, and seems to bear his misfortunes with a
    degree of philosophical resignation that but few men in similar
    circumstances are gifted with. On Thursday last General Hull,
    with eight American officers, left this city for the United
    States, on their parole.</p>

  and while on his voyage across Lake Erie, in the schooner
  Chippewa, he was met on the 23d of August by the provincial
  schooner Lady Prevost, of 14 guns, the commander of which, after
  saluting the general with seventeen guns, came on board and gave
  him the first intelligence of the armistice which Sir George
  Prevost had unfortunately concluded with the American general,
  Dearborn. Major-General Brock could not conceal his deep regret
  and mortification at the intelligence, which he feared would
  prevent his contemplated attack on Sackett's Harbour. Sir George
  Prevost, early in August, on hearing of the repeal of the British
  orders in council, which were the principal among the alleged
  causes of the war, had proposed a suspension of hostilities until
  the sentiments of the American government were received on the
  subject; and to this suspension <a name="Page_275" id=
  "Page_275"></a>General Dearborn readily agreed, with the
  exception of the forces under General Hull, who, he said, acted
  under the immediate orders of the secretary at war. But, by the
  terms of the truce, General Hull had the option of availing
  himself of its provisions if he thought fit, and that he would
  gladly have done so there can be no doubt. Happily, however,
  owing to the rapidity of Major-General Brock's movements, the
  news of the armistice did not reach the belligerent commanders in
  time to prevent the surrender of the one, or to snatch
  well-earned laurels from the brow of the other.<a name=
  "FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> This armistice was
  attended with very prejudicial consequences, as it not only
  marred the attempt on Sackett's Harbour, but it rendered
  unavailing the command of the lakes, which was then held by the
  British.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

  <p>The successful commander, in transmitting by Captain Glegg his
  dispatches to the governor-general at Montreal, expressed,
  through his aide-de-camp, his intention of proceeding immediately
  to Kingston, and from thence to the attack of the naval arsenal
  at Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. Had its destruction been
  accomplished&mdash;and no one can doubt that this was the proper
  <a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>period to attempt it, as the
  enemy, dispirited by the capture of Detroit, would probably have
  offered but a feeble resistance&mdash;the Americans could not,
  without much additional difficulty and future risk of
  destruction, have built and equipped the fleet which subsequently
  gave them the naval ascendancy on that lake, and enabled them
  twice in 1813 to capture the capital of Upper Canada. The
  armistice, however, caused a delay of nearly a fortnight in the
  necessary preparations, as Major-General Brock returned from
  Detroit to Fort George on the 24th of August, and the cessation
  of the truce was not known to him until his arrival at Kingston,
  on the 4th of September. The distance by water between Fort
  George and Kingston is about 160 miles, and from Kingston to
  Sackett's Harbour only 35 miles; so that the destruction of the
  arsenal might have been effected early in September, had not the
  armistice prevented the attempt. But, unhappily for the interests
  of his country and the credit of his own fame, Sir George Prevost
  disapproved of the proposition, and commanded Major-General Brock
  to relinquish all idea of the contemplated enterprize, although
  the official intelligence of the president's refusal to continue
  the suspension of hostilities reached him at Montreal on the 30th
  of August, a day or two <i>before</i> Captain Glegg, with the
  dispatches and trophies of the capture of Detroit. At the
  commencement of the war, a defensive attitude was perhaps
  excusable, especially as the British cabinet <a name="Page_277"
  id="Page_277"></a>seems to have been anxious to accommodate the
  differences between the two countries; but <i>after</i> the
  American government had refused to continue the armistice, it
  appears to us that Sir George Prevost was pursuing a suicidal
  course, as to wait for the enemy till he shall have prepared his
  forces and passed your frontiers, to plunder your towns and
  occupy your country, is a very recent expedient recognized by no
  government, and practised by no people of ancient or modern
  times. But notwithstanding the delay caused by the armistice, the
  proposed attack could still have been carried into effect after
  its cessation; and it was only relinquished by express orders
  from the commander-in-chief. We seek not to impugn his motives,
  as they probably originated in a mistaken sense of duty, and
  evidently from an impression that to attack the Americans again
  on their own frontier would be to render the contest more popular
  among them. It was under this impression that, in a general
  order<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> issued at Montreal on
  the 31st of August, the commander-in-chief was weak enough to
  offer an indirect apology to the American people for the invasion
  of their territory at Detroit. Whether this continued defensive
  policy was such as, under all the circumstances, ought to have
  been observed, we leave it to others to determine; but certainly
  the result did not justify its expediency, and the tree is
  usually judged of by its fruit. Forbearance in war, where
  suc<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>cess is probable, strikes
  us as a positive evil that a very doubtful good may
  ensue&mdash;it is seldom properly appreciated; and the
  governor-general appears to have seen his error when too late, as
  in the following year he was himself ignobly foiled in an attack
  on Sackett's Harbour. We cannot understand why the attack under
  Sir George Prevost, in May, 1813, was more politic than it would
  have been in September the year preceding, under Major-General
  Brock; and although Captain Glegg met with a very chilling
  reception from the former officer, yet we would willingly acquit
  him of any jealous feeling where such important interests were at
  stake. At the same time it is due to the memory of this
  unfortunate officer to add, that his civil administration was as
  able as his military one in Canada was inglorious; and that
  although his conduct as a soldier was on more than one occasion
  the subject of much and just animadversion in England, yet he
  acquired the warm attachment of the French Canadians, who speak
  highly of him to this day. Those leading men who, during the
  administration of Sir James Craig, had been considered almost as
  enemies, were treated with confidence by his successor, who
  gradually appointed them to situations of trust, and by this wise
  measure secured their aid and influence in the defence of the
  province. Certain it is, on the other hand, that Major-General
  Brock did not approve of the defensive warfare to which he was
  restricted, and subsequent <a name="Page_279" id=
  "Page_279"></a>events too truly proved that had he been permitted
  to pursue that course which his zeal and foresight dictated, his
  valuable life might have been spared, and a very different series
  of incidents in that war claimed the attention of the historian.
  The high-minded soldier could not brook a state of inaction with
  such promising prospects before him. His best feelings revolted
  at being compelled to languish within the strict pale of military
  obedience, when so rich a field for doing good service presented
  itself; and in place of becoming the assailant, he was soon
  doomed, by awaiting the attacks of his opponents, to sacrifice
  not only life, but, what is far dearer, the opening prospects of
  honorable ambition.</p>

  <p>On the 16th December, 1812, the inhabitants of the Niagara
  district addressed a spirited letter to Sir George Prevost, from
  which we copy the following extract, as confirming what we have
  already stated on the same subject: "Nevertheless, such was the
  popularity of the general, such the confidence he had inspired,
  that he was enabled to carry with him to Detroit, though under
  great privations, a large body of volunteers, which, in addition
  to the small regular force at Amherstburg, enabled him to capture
  an entire army of our invaders, with the fortress from which they
  had made their descent into Canada&mdash;a success unparalleled
  in the annals of war. Here, for the first time, we got a supply
  of good arms. The success of this first enterprize, in which the
  militia <a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>were engaged, acted
  like an electric shock throughout the country: it awed the
  disaffected, of whom there were many; it confirmed the timid and
  the wavering; and it induced the Six Nation Indians, who had
  until that time kept aloof, to take an active part in our favor.
  At that moment such was the energy and confidence that had been
  excited by our illustrious chief and the success of his plans,
  that had <i>he</i> been permitted, he could, and would, have
  destroyed and laid waste the whole American frontier, from
  Sandusky to St. Regis. Your excellency doubtless recollects the
  armistice which immediately preceded the capture of Detroit,
  which gave the enemy an opportunity to recover from their
  consternation, to fortify and strengthen their lines, to
  accumulate in security the means of annoying us at pleasure along
  our whole frontier, and which sent at least 800 of our Indian
  allies in disgust to their own homes."</p>

    <p>I wrote to you from Albany on the 8th instant, but as my
    letter was submitted to the inspection of General Dearborn, I
    of course confined myself to the sole subject of the armistice
    entered into with that officer.... A clause, admitting
    reinforcements to pass with stores, was readily agreed to
    <a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>on my part. General
    Dearborn told me that a considerable reinforcement with stores
    was on its way to Niagara, and that he could not delay or alter
    its destination. I informed him that we were also forwarding
    reinforcements and stores, and that it would be advisable to
    agree that all movements of that nature on either side should
    be suffered to proceed unmolestedly by troops under
    instructions to preserve defensive measures. I am apprehensive
    that General Dearborn may not explicitly explain all these
    points; and I have therefore cautioned all the officers, to
    whom I have communicated them, to act with the utmost caution,
    and to be prepared for all events that may arise. I feel
    extremely prepossessed in favor of General Dearborn, whose
    manners appear to evince great candour and sincerity: he
    assured me that no event of his life would afford him so much
    satisfaction and happiness as resigning his command in
    consequence of our honorable adjustment of differences. He told
    me that General Hull was placed under his orders merely for
    form sake, but that he acted by particular instructions from
    the war department, and would not consider himself bound to
    obey any order that was not in conformity to them.</p>

    <p>[Colonel Baynes describes at length the incipient state of
    military preparation for the invasion of Lower Canada, which he
    witnessed on his journey; and after mentioning that the
    Americans had sent the most efficient of their forces to the
    Niagara frontier, he adds:]</p>

    <p><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>Under all these
    circumstances, which I have represented to Sir George, I have
    strongly urged his sending you further reinforcements, which I
    am sure can be spared: we are at present checked from the want
    of conveyance, but I trust after the corps, now on their route,
    are dispatched, that Sir George will be induced to send you
    further aid, and that of the best description. I think it of
    the highest importance, particularly if we are likely to
    arrange matters with the States, that the balance of military
    events should be unequivocally in our favor. I found a very
    general prejudice prevailing with Jonathan, of his own
    resources and means of invading these provinces, and of our
    weakness and inability to resist, both exaggerated in a most
    absurd and extravagant degree&mdash;a little practical
    correction of this error would be attended with the best
    effects.</p>

    hostilities had been agreed upon between Sir George Prevost and
    General Dearborn, and requesting you in consequence to postpone
    any attempt upon Fort Wayne, or any other post of the enemy. I

    grounds foreign from the present considerations.</p>

    <p>Colonel Myers tells me that he forwarded on the 11th instant
    a dispatch received from Sir George Prevost to me, in which his
    excellency so clearly stated the principles of moderation upon
    which he thought it expedient to act, that I fully expect,
    should you have received the dispatch and perused his
    sentiments, you will forbear from any hostile aggression; in

  <p>Major-General Brock arrived at Kingston on the 4th of
  September, and left it on the 6th for Fort George. During this
  hasty visit he reviewed the militia, and expressed his
  satisfaction at its <a name="Page_284" id=
  "Page_284"></a>evolutions and appearance. He also received a
  flattering address from the magistrates, officers of militia, and
  other inhabitants; and in reply he told them with much tact, that
  it was the confidence inspired by the admirable conduct of the
  York and Lincoln regiments of militia which had induced him to
  undertake the expedition which terminated in the capture of
  Detroit, and that from the report of the officers of the garrison
  at Kingston, he relied with the same confidence on the bravery
  and the discipline of the militia of that district. In the same
  manner, in an address a few days before from the inhabitants of
  York, he said: "Gentlemen,&mdash;I cannot but feel highly
  gratified by this expression of your esteem for myself; but, in
  justice to the brave men at whose head I marched against the
  enemy, I must beg leave to direct your attention to them, as the
  proper objects of your gratitude. It was a confidence, founded on
  their loyalty, zeal, and valour, that determined me to adopt the
  plan of operations which led to so fortunate a termination. Allow
  me to congratulate you, gentlemen, at having sent out from among
  yourselves a large portion of that gallant band; and that at such
  a period a spirit had manifested itself, on which you may
  confidently repose your hopes of future security. It will be a
  most pleasing duty for me to report to our sovereign a conduct so
  truly meritorious."</p>

    <p>Upon my arrival here an hour ago, Captain Fulton delivered
    me your excellency's dispatch, dated the 31st ultimo, enclosing
    a letter from General Dearborn, in which the president's
    disapproval of the armistice is announced. I am in consequence
    induced to return without loss of time to Fort George. Captain
    Fulton having expressed a wish to accompany me, I have the more
    readily consented, as he will be able to give you full
    information of our actual state. The enemy was very busy upon

    <p>I enclose several documents lately received from Colonel

    <p>FORT GEORGE, September 9, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have been honored with your excellency's dispatch, dated
    the 24th ultimo, and have to thank you for ordering a company
    of the Glengary regiment to strengthen Colonel Lethbridge at
    Prescott, whose force you have been led to believe was weakened
    in consequence of my interference, but which, I beg leave to
    state, was done without my knowledge, and contrary to my
    intention.</p>

    <p>The enclosed copies of letters will inform you of the state
    of affairs to the westward. It appears evident the enemy
    meditates a second attempt on Amherstburg. The greater part of
    the troops, which are advancing, marched from Kentucky with an
    intention of joining General Hull. How they are to subsist,
    even for a short period, in that already exhausted country, is
    no easy matter to conceive. This difficulty will probably
    decide them on some bold measure, in the hope of shortening the
    campaign. If successfully resisted, their fate is
    inevitable.</p>

    <p>The Indians, it appears by the accompanying documents, were
    adverse to retreating without first making a trial of their
    strength. Taking, however, every circumstance into
    consideration, I am inclined to think that Captain Muir acted
    judi<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>ciously. Should the
    Indians continue to afford a willing co-operation, I entertain
    not the smallest doubt of the result that awaits this second
    attempt to turn my right; but your excellency will easily
    perceive that doubts and jealousies have already seized their
    minds. The officers of the Indian department will, I trust, be
    able to remove all such impressions. Although, from the daily
    observations of what is passing on the opposite shore, a single
    man can ill be spared from this line, I have notwithstanding
    determined to send the two flank companies of the royal
    Newfoundland regiment to Amherstburg. Fresh troops are daily
    arriving, supposed to belong to the Pennsylvania quota of 2,000
    men, known to be intended for this frontier. After the whole
    arrive, an attack, I imagine, cannot be long delayed. The
    wretched state of their quotas, and the raggedness of the
    troops, will not allow them to brave the rain and cold, which
    during the last week have been so severely felt.</p>

    <p>Between 200 and 300 Indians have joined and augmented the
    force on the other side. Their brethren here feel certain that
    they will not act with any spirit against us&mdash;so I
    imagine, if we continue to shew a bold front; but in the event
    of a disaster, the love of plunder will prevail, and they will
    then act in a manner to be the most dreaded by the inhabitants
    of this country.</p>

    <p>I beg leave to recommend to your excellency's indulgent
    consideration, Colonel Proctor's appli<a name="Page_288" id=

  <p><i>Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>MONTREAL, September 10, 1812.</p>

    <p>Sir George writes to you so fully upon the several subjects
    to which your letters refer, that I have little left to
    communicate to you. Major Heathcote leaves this to-day, with
    all the small description of ordnance stores intended for
    Amherstburg, but we have detained the 12-pounders and shot; as
    you have helped yourself so amply at Detroit, it is imagined
    you do not now want them. I enclose a letter from Captain
    Roberts, who was, I suppose, induced to address himself direct
    to head quarters, by an opportunity of doing so offering itself
    at the moment. The North-West gentlemen are very urgent in
    recommending a reinforcement in that quarter; but Sir George
    has told them that their representation must be addressed to
    you, who will act as you deem proper.</p>

    <p>Your friend, Mr. Isaac Todd, is arrived, and looking much
    better for his trip; he was suffered to pass by Albany and the
    lake. He tells me that Mr. M'Donell is confirmed
    attorney-general, and that the governor's salary is increased,
    &pound;1,000 a year. I sincerely trust that it will soon be
    your own. Sir George has in his official dispatches, after
    paying that tribute of praise so justly your due, stated as his
    confirmed opinion, that the sal<a name="Page_289" id=
    "Page_289"></a>vation of the Upper Province has in a very great
    measure arisen from the civil and military authority being
    combined in able hands. The prisoners, with their general,
    arrived here on Sunday night; as they had not halted since they
    left Kingston, and were in a very dirty state, we kept them
    here on Monday, and they yesterday proceeded to William Henry,
    on their way to Quebec; the officers are to be on parole in
    Charlesbourg, and the men confined on board two transports in
    the river. Sir George has permitted most of the officers, who
    have families with them, to return on their parole; four of
    them are proposed to be exchanged for the officers of the Royal
    Scots, taken by the Essex frigate. Sir George has also
    consented to allow General Hull to return upon his parole: he
    is loud in his complaints against the government at Washington,
    and the general thinks that his voice, in the general cry, may
    be attended with beneficial effects, and has allowed him to
    return and enter the lists. General Hull appears to possess
    less feeling and sense of shame than any man in his situation
    could be supposed to do. He seems to be perfectly satisfied
    with himself, is lavish of censure upon his government, but
    appears to think that the most scrupulous cannot attach the
    slightest blame to his own immediate conduct at Detroit. The
    grounds upon which he rests his defence are not, I fancy, well
    founded, for he told us that he had not gunpowder at Detroit
    for the service of one day. Sir George has since shown him the
    <a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>return of the large supply
    found in the fort; it did not create a blush, but he made no
    reply. He professes great surprise and admiration at the zeal
    and military preparation that he has everywhere witnessed; that
    it was entirely unlooked for, and that he has no doubt that his
    friend, General Dearborn, will share his fate, if he has the
    imprudence to follow his example. Hull seems cunning and
    unprincipled: how much reliance is to be placed on his
    professions, time will shew.</p>

    <p>General Dearborn has certainly left Albany for
    Skeensborough, at the head of the lake, where great
    preparations have been making in collecting boats and sending
    the regulars from Greenbush to the stations in our vicinity.
    Major Cotton, with about 300 men, half of the king's regiment,
    is stationed at Isle aux Noix,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id=
    "FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class=
    "fnanchor">[90]</a> and two gun-boats have been carried into
    that river, as the enemy's preparations seem to indicate that
    quarter as their point of attack. Colonel Murray commands at
    St. John's, and will give them a warm reception. I do not feel
    a doubt of Jonathan's complete discomfiture and disgrace if he
    make the attempt: we could, I fancy, bring as many men as he
    will be able to persuade into the field, and of very superior
    stuff, for our militia have really improved <a name="Page_291"
    id="Page_291"></a>beyond all expectation in discipline, and
    with it in spirit and confidence. This town would turn out
    2,000 volunteer militia, a great proportion of whom are clothed
    and very tolerably drilled. We have destroyed all the roads of
    communication in our front, leaving open the water route only,
    and these woody positions will be shortly occupied by the
    Indians of this neighbourhood and a corps of volunteer
    <i>voyageur</i> Canadians. The enemy's preparations, however,
    may be a feint to cover some plans in agitation against your
    province.</p>

    <p>I send you a long letter from Kempt for your perusal, with a
    sketch of Badajos, though no longer recent news. I am sure the
    interest you take in the success of our arms, and in his share
    in particular, will induce you to read it with pleasure.</p>

    you last reported to me. You will therefore be pleased, subject
    to the discretion I have given you under the circumstances to
    which I have alluded, to take immediate steps for eva<a name=
    "Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>cuating that post, together with
    the territory of Michigan; by this measure you will be enabled
    to withdraw a greater number of the troops from Amherstburg,
    instead of taking them from Colonel Vincent, whose regular
    force ought not on any account to be diminished.</p>

    <p>I have already afforded you reinforcements to the full
    extent of my ability; you must not, therefore, expect a further
    supply of men from hence until I shall receive from England a
    considerable increase to the present regular force in this
    province: the posture of affairs, particularly on this
    frontier, requires every soldier who is in the country.</p>

    <p>In my last dispatch from Lord Bathurst, dated the 4th of
    July, he tells me, "that his majesty's government trusts I will
    be enabled to suspend with perfect safety all extraordinary
    preparations for defence which I may have been induced to make
    in consequence of the precarious state of the relations between
    this country and the United States; and that as every specific
    requisition for warlike stores and accoutrements which had been
    received from me had been complied with, with the exception of
    the clothing of the corps proposed to be raised from the
    Glengary emigrants, he had not thought it necessary to direct
    the preparation of any further supplies." This will afford you
    a strong proof of the infatuation of his majesty's ministers
    upon the subject of American affairs, and shew how entirely I
    have been left to my own resources in the event which has taken
    place.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>Judging from what you
    have already effected in Upper Canada, I do not doubt but that,
    with your present means of defence, you will be able to
    maintain your position at Fort George, and that the enemy will
    be again foiled in any further attempts they may make to invade
    the province.</p>

    <p>I leave to your discretion to decide on the necessity of
    sending a reinforcement to Michilimakinack.</p>

    <p>FORT GEORGE, September 17, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have had before me your several communications to the 11th
    instant, addressed to myself and to Major-General Sheaffe. I
    approve of your having detached a party to aid in the reduction
    of Fort Wayne, not only because its destruction will render
    your position more secure, but also from the probable result of
    saving the garrison from sharing the fate of that of Chicago;
    but it must be explicitly understood, that you are not to
    resort to offensive warfare for purposes of conquest. Your
    operations are to be confined to measures of defence and
    security. With this view, if you should have credible
    information of the assembling of bodies of troops to march
    against you, it may become necessary to destroy the fort at
    Sandusky, and the road which runs through it from Cleveland to
    the foot of the rapids: the road from the river Raisin to
    Detroit is perhaps in too bad a state to offer any aid to the
    approach of an enemy, except <a name="Page_294" id=
    "Page_294"></a>in the winter; and if a winter campaign should
    be contemplated against you, it is probable that magazines
    would be formed in Cleveland and its vicinity, of all which you
    will of course inform yourself. In carrying on our operations
    in your quarter, it is of primary importance that the
    confidence and good-will of the Indians should be preserved,
    and that whatsoever can tend to produce a contrary effect
    should be most carefully avoided. I therefore most strongly
    urge and enjoin your acting on those principles on every
    occasion that may offer, inculcating them in all those under
    your influence, and enforcing them by your example, whether in
    your conduct towards the Indians or what may regard them, or in
    your language when speaking to, or of, them. I am aware that
    they commit irregularities at times, which will make this a
    difficult task; but you must endeavour to perform
    it&mdash;attending at the same time to the means already
    suggested to you for preventing, as much as possible, a
    repetition of disorderly conduct.</p>

    <p>Colonel E&mdash;&mdash; is a respectable, gentlemanly man,
    but he by no means possesses the influence over the Indians
    which Captain M'K&mdash;&mdash; does. I recommend to you to
    promote, as far as in you lies, a good understanding with and
    between them, and to observe a conciliating deportment and
    language towards the latter, that his great influence may be
    secured and employed in its fullest extent for the benefit of
    your district, and for the general <a name="Page_295" id=
    "Page_295"></a>good. In conversation with him, you may take an
    opportunity of intimating, that I have not been unmindful of
    the interests of the Indians in my communications to ministers;
    and I wish you to learn (as if casually the subject of
    conversation) what stipulations they would propose for
    themselves, or be willing to accede to, in case either of
    failure or of success.</p>

    <p>I understand that salvage has been demanded from individuals
    on several accounts; for property recovered or restored, for
    patents, &amp;c. &amp;c. I lament that such a course has been
    adopted, for it was my intention, and it is now my wish, that
    our conduct in those matters should be governed by the broadest
    principles of liberality. You will, therefore, be pleased to
    have returned to the several individuals the amount which each
    may have paid as salvage on any account.</p>

    <p>With respect to calling out the militia, I am particularly
    desirous that it should not be resorted to but in case of
    urgent necessity, and then only in such numbers as shall be
    actually required. It appears to me that the cavalry employed
    exceed the number that may be indispensably necessary: if,
    without risk or detriment to the public service, any of either
    of those corps can be spared, let them be dismissed.</p>

    <p>I wish the engineer to proceed immediately in strengthening
    Fort Amherstburg, his plan for which I shall be glad to see as
    soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Of the ordnance stores of every description, you <a name=
    "Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>will reserve such proportions as
    may be absolutely required for the public service in your
    district, and cause the remainder to be embarked and sent down
    to Fort Erie with the least possible delay.</p>

    <p>I cannot at present make the change in the distribution of
    the 41st regiment which you propose, but, whenever
    circumstances may permit, I shall be happy to accede to your
    wishes.</p>

    permission for an interview with Captain Dyson, for the purpose
    of ascertaining, particularly, the condition of the prisoners
    of war under his charge, to the end that they may be relieved
    from Fort Niagara, if practicable; and if not, that I may,
    without delay, state their condition to the government, that
    they may receive from the proper department the earliest
    possible supplies.</p>

    <p>The women and children, and such other persons as have
    accompanied the detachment from Detroit, and ought to be here
    received, I will immediately <a name="Page_297" id=

    convenient place as you may order them to be landed at.</p>

    <p>In a communication which I some time since had the honor of
    receiving from Lieut.-Colonel Myers, he assured me that it had
    been the constant study of the general officer commanding on
    this line to discountenance, by all means in his power, the
    warfare of sentinels; yet the frequent recurrence of this
    warfare within a few days past, would warrant the presumption
    that a different course has been adopted. I wish to be assured

  <p><i>Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, September 18, 1812.</p>

    <p>I have been honored with your excellency's dispatch, dated
    the 7th instant. I have implicitly followed your excellency's
    instructions, and abstained, under great temptation and
    provocation, from every act of hostility. The information
    received from a deserter, and which I had the honor to detail
    in my last, is far from correct, and, where credit is to be
    given, the facts apply solely to the regular force. The
    militia, being selected from the most violent democrats, are
    generally inclined to invade this province&mdash;provisions are
    in tolerable plenty&mdash;the only complaint arises from
    <a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>a want of vegetables. It
    is currently reported that the enemy's force is to be increased
    to 7,000, and that on their arrival an attack is immediately to
    be made. I am convinced the militia would not keep together in
    their present situation without such a prospect, nor do I think
    the attempt can be long deferred. Sickness prevails in some
    degree along the line, but principally at Black Rock.</p>

    <p>The flank companies of the royal Newfoundland have joined
    me. A sergeant and twenty-five rank and file of the Veterans
    arrived at the same time, whom I propose sending to
    Michilimakinack.</p>

    <p>The enclosed letter from Colonel Proctor will inform your
    excellency of a force having been detached, under Captain Muir,
    for the reduction of Fort Wayne.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id=
    "FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class=
    "fnanchor">[91]</a> I gave orders for it previous to my leaving
    Amherstburg, which must have induced Colonel Proctor to
    proceed, upon receiving intelligence of the recommencement of
    hostilities, without waiting for further directions. I regret
    exceedingly that this service should be undertaken contrary to
    your excellency's wishes; but I beg leave to assure you, that
    the principal object in sending a British force to Fort Wayne
    is with the hope of preserving the lives of the garrison. By
    the last accounts, the place was invested by a numerous body of
    Indians, with very little pros<a name="Page_300" id=
    "Page_300"></a>pect of being relieved. The prisoners of war,
    who know perfectly the situation of the garrison, rejoiced at
    the measure, and give us full credit for our intentions.</p>

    <p>The Indians were likewise looking to us for assistance: they
    heard of the armistice with every mark of jealousy, and, had we
    refused joining them in the expedition, it is impossible to
    calculate the consequences. I have already been asked to pledge
    my word that England would enter into no negociation in which
    their interests were not included, and, could they be brought
    to imagine that we should desert them, the consequences must be
    fatal.</p>

    <p>I shall be obliged to your excellency to direct &pound;5,000
    to be transmitted to the receiver-general, for the civil
    expenditure of this province. Army bills, I make no doubt, will
    answer every purpose.</p>

    <p>This dispatch is entrusted to Lieut.-Colonel Nichol,
    quartermaster-general of this militia, whom I take the liberty
    to introduce to your excellency, as perfectly qualified, from
    his local knowledge and late return, to afford every
    information of the state of affairs in the western district. He
    is instructed to make extensive purchases of necessaries for
    the use of the militia, and I have to entreat your excellency
    to indulge him with the means of a speedy conveyance back to
    this place.</p>

    <p>FORT GEORGE, September 18, 1812.</p>

    <p>You doubtless feel much anxiety on my account. I am really
    placed in a most awkward predicament. If I get through my
    present difficulties with tolerable success, I cannot but
    obtain praise. But I have already surmounted difficulties of
    infinitely greater magnitude than any within my view. Were the
    Americans of one mind, the opposition I could make would be
    unavailing; but I am not without hope that their divisions may
    be the saving of this province. A river of about 500 yards
    broad divides the troops. My instructions oblige me to adopt
    defensive measures, and I have evinced greater forbearance than
    was ever practised on any former occasion. It is thought that,
    without the aid of the sword, the American people may be
    brought to a due sense of their own interests. I firmly believe
    I could at this moment sweep every thing before me between Fort
    Niagara and Buffalo&mdash;but my success would be
    transient.</p>

    <p>I have now officers in whom I can confide: when the war
    commenced, I was really obliged to seek assistance among the
    militia. The 41st is an uncommonly fine regiment, but
    wretchedly officered. Six companies of the 49th are with me
    here, and the remaining four at Kingston, under Vincent.
    Although the regiment has been ten years in this country,
    drinking rum without bounds, it is still respectable, and
    apparently ar<a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>dent for an
    opportunity to acquire distinction: it has five captains in
    England, and two on the staff in this country, which leaves it
    bare of experienced officers. The U.S. regiments of the line
    desert over to us frequently, as the men are tired of the
    service: opportunities seldom offer, otherwise I have reason to
    think the greater part would follow the example. The militia,
    being chiefly composed of enraged democrats, are more ardent
    and anxious to engage, but they have neither subordination nor
    discipline. They die very fast. You will hear of some decisive
    action in the course of a fortnight, or in all probability we
    shall return to a state of tranquillity. I say decisive,
    because if I should be beaten, the province is inevitably gone;
    and should I be victorious, I do not imagine the gentry from
    the other side will be anxious to return to the charge.</p>

    <p>It is certainly something singular that we should be upwards
    of two months in a state of warfare, and that along this widely
    extended frontier not a single death, either natural or by the
    sword, should have occurred among the troops under my command,
    and we have not been altogether idle, nor has a single
    desertion taken place.</p>

    <p>I am quite anxious for this state of warfare to end, as I
    wish much to join Lord Wellington, and to see you all.</p>

    <p>It no longer appears, by your letter of the 13th, that you
    consider the enemy's operations on the Niagara frontier
    indicative of active operations. If the government of America
    inclines to defensive measures, I can only ascribe the
    determination to two causes: the first is, the expectation of
    such overtures from us as will lead to a suspension of
    hostilities, preparatory to negociations for peace; the other
    arises from having ascertained, by experience, our ability in
    the Canadas to resist the attack of a tumultuary force.</p>

    <p>In consequence of your having weakened the line of
    communication between Cornwall and Kingston, a predatory
    warfare is carrying on there very prejudicial to the
    intercourse from hence with Upper Canada. I have ordered a
    company of the Glengary to Prescott to strengthen Colonel
    Lethbridge, and, under present circumstances, you are not to
    expect further aid.</p>

    <p>I agree in opinion with you, that so wretched is the
    organization and discipline of the American army, that at this
    moment much might be effected against them; but as the
    government at home could derive no substantial advantage from
    any disgrace we might inflict on them, whilst the more
    important concerns of the country are committed in Europe, I
    again request you will steadily pursue that policy which shall
    appear to you best <a name="Page_304" id=
    "Page_304"></a>calculated to promote the dwindling away of such
    a force by its own inefficient means.</p>

    <p>I shall receive with much satisfaction Colonel Proctor's
    report of having saved the garrison of Fort Wayne from the
    inhuman fury of the Indians. I am particularly anxious that
    class of beings should be restrained and controlled as much as
    possible, whilst there exists a pretence of implicating the
    national character in their cruelties.</p>

  <p>The following letter not only explains the impolicy of obeying
  Sir George Prevost's provisional orders for the evacuation of
  Detroit and the Michigan territory, but also ably deprecates any
  abandonment of our Indian allies. With such leaders as its author
  and Tecumseh, what might not have been done in this war to obtain
  the security and regeneration of this much injured people? But
  alas! these "kindred spirits" lived not long enough to plead
  their cause, and in the negociations for peace their interests
  were shamefully overlooked or cruelly forgotten;<a name=
  "FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> although, in the
  first American war, the Indians had also, with few exceptions,
  taken part with Great Britain against the colonists in their
  contest for independence. It is true that their mode of warfare
  is abhorrent <a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>to Europeans,
  as differing from the more <i>honorable</i> slaughter of
  <i>civilized</i> enemies; but Sir Isaac Brock proved that they
  were to be restrained, and Tecumseh was as humane as he was
  brave. Moreover, we should not condemn their previous excesses
  without remembering the many injuries they had received. They
  knew from sad experience that they could place no faith in the
  whites, who had long considered them as legal prey, and too often
  treated them as the brute animals of the forest. Expelled from
  the coasts, and dispossessed of their hunting grounds, they had
  been gradually driven westward, until they had too much cause to
  apprehend that the cupidity of their invaders would be satisfied
  only with their utter extermination. "The red men are melting,"
  to borrow the expressive metaphor of a celebrated Miami chief of
  the last century, "like snow before the sun." Indeed, it is
  melancholy to reflect, that the aborigines of both continents of
  America have, from their first intercourse with Europeans or
  their descendants, experienced nothing but fraud, spoliation,
  cruelty, and ingratitude.</p>

    your excellency to my <a name="Page_306" id=
    "Page_306"></a>discretion, the evacuation of Fort Detroit. Such
    a measure would most probably be followed by the total
    extinction of the population on that side of the river, or the
    Indians, aware of our weakness and inability to carry on active
    warfare, would only think of entering into terms with the
    enemy. The Indians, since the Miami affair, in 1793, have been
    extremely suspicious of our conduct; but the violent wrongs
    committed by the Americans on their territory, have rendered it
    an act of policy with them to disguise their sentiments. Could
    they be persuaded that a peace between the belligerents would
    take place, without admitting their claim to an extensive tract
    of country, fraudulently usurped from them, and opposing a
    frontier to the present unbounded views of the Americans, I am
    satisfied in my own mind that they would immediately compromise
    with the enemy. I cannot conceive a connection so likely to
    lead to more awful consequences.</p>

    <p>If we can maintain ourselves at Niagara, and keep the
    communication to Montreal open, the Americans can only subdue
    the Indians by craft, which we ought to be prepared to see
    exerted to the utmost. The enmity of the Indians is now at its
    height, and it will require much management and large bribes to
    effect a change in their policy; but the moment they are
    convinced that we either want the means to prosecute the war
    with spirit, or are negociating a separate peace, they will
    begin to study in what manner they can most effectually deceive
    us.</p>

    including the Indians as allies, and not leave them exposed to
    the unrelenting fury of their enemies.</p>

    <p>The enemy has evidently assumed defensive measures along the
    strait of Niagara. His force, I apprehend, is not equal to
    attempt, with any probability of success, an expedition across
    the river. It is, however, currently reported that large
    reinforcements are on their march; should they arrive, an
    attack cannot be long delayed. The approach of the rainy season
    will increase the sickness with which the troops are already
    afflicted. Those under my command are in perfect health and
    spirits.</p>

    white men. We, ourselves, are threatened with a great evil;
    nothing will pacify them but the destruction of all the red
    men.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;When the white men first set foot on our
    grounds, they were hungry; they had no place on which to spread
    their blankets, or to kindle their fires. They were feeble;
    they could do nothing for themselves. Our fathers commiserated
    their distress, and shared freely with them whatever the Great
    Spirit had given his red children. They gave them food when
    hungry, medicine when sick, spread skins for them to sleep on,
    and gave them grounds, that they might hunt and raise
    corn.&mdash;Brothers, the white people are like poisonous
    serpents: when chilled, they are feeble and harmless; but
    invigorate them with warmth, and they sting their benefactors
    to death.</p>

    <p>The white people came among us feeble; and now that we have
    made them strong, they wish to kill us, or drive us back, as
    they would wolves and panthers. <a name="Page_309" id=
    "Page_309"></a>Brothers,&mdash;The white men are not friends to
    the Indians: at first, they only asked for land sufficient for
    a wigwam; now, nothing will satisfy them but the whole of our
    hunting grounds, from the rising to the setting sun.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;The white men want more than our hunting
    grounds; they wish to kill our old men, women, and little
    ones.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;Many winters ago, there was no land; the sun
    did not rise and set; all was darkness. The Great Spirit made
    all things. He gave the white people a home beyond the great
    waters. He supplied these grounds with game, and gave them to
    his red children; and he gave them strength and courage to
    defend them.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;My people wish for peace; the red men all
    wish for peace; but where the white people are, there is no
    peace for them, except it be on the bosom of our mother.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;The white men despise and cheat the Indians;
    they abuse and insult them; they do not think the red men
    sufficiently good to live.</p>

    <p>The red men have borne many and great injuries; they ought
    to suffer them no longer. My people will not; they are
    determined on vengeance; they have taken up the tomahawk; they
    will make it fat with blood; they will drink the blood of the
    white people.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;My people are brave and numerous; but the
    white people are too strong for them alone. I wish you to take
    up the tomahawk with them. If we all unite, we will cause the
    rivers to stain the great waters with their blood.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;If you do not unite with us, they will first
    destroy us, and then you will fall an easy prey to them. They
    have destroyed many nations of red men, because they were not
    united, because they were not friends to each other.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;The white people send runners amongst us;
    they wish to make us enemies, that they may sweep over <a name=
    "Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>and desolate our hunting grounds,
    like devastating winds, or rushing waters.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;Our Great Father, over the great waters, is
    angry with the white people, our enemies. He will send his
    brave warriors against them; he will send us rifles, and
    whatever else we want&mdash;he is our friend, and we are his
    children.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;Who are the white people that we should fear
    them? They cannot run fast, and are good marks to shoot at:
    they are only men; our fathers have killed many of them: we are
    not squaws, and we will stain the earth red with their
    blood.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;The Great Spirit is angry with our enemies;
    he speaks in thunder, and the earth swallows up villages, and
    drinks up the Mississippi. The great waters will cover their
    lowlands; their corn cannot grow; and the Great Spirit will
    sweep those who escape to the hills from the earth with his
    terrible breath.</p>

    <p>Brothers,&mdash;We must be united; we must smoke the same
    pipe; we must fight each other's battles; and, more than all,
    we must love the Great Spirit: he is for us; he will destroy
    our enemies, and make all his red children happy.</p>

  <p>Conclusion of Major-General Brock's general order, Detroit,
  16th August, 1812: "The conduct of the Indians under Colonel
  Elliott, Captain M'Kee, and the other officers of that
  department, joined to that of the gallant and brave chiefs of
  their respective tribes, has since the commencement of the war
  been marked with acts of true heroism, and in nothing can they
  testify more strongly their love to the king, their great father,
  than in following the dictates of honor and humanity, by which
  they have been hitherto actuated. Two fortifications have already
  been captured from the enemy, without a drop of blood being shed
  by the hands of the Indians: the instant the enemy submitted, his
  life became sacred."</p>

  <p>The Americans, burning to wipe away the stain of their
  discomfiture at Detroit, and apparently determined to penetrate
  into Upper Canada at any risk, concentrated with those views,
  along the Niagara frontier, an army consisting, according to
  their own official returns, of 5,206 men, under Major-General Van
  Rensselaer, of the New York militia, exclusive of 300 field and
  light artillery, 800 of the 6th, 13th, and 23d regiments, at Fort
  Niagara; making a total of 6,300 men. Of this powerful force,
  1,650 regulars, under the command of Brigadier Smyth, were at
  Black Rock; 386 militia at the last named place and Buffalo; and
  900 regulars and 2,270 militia at Lewistown, distant from Black
  Rock 28 miles. Thus the enemy had, along their frontier of 36
  miles, 3,650 regulars and 2,650 militia.<a name="FNanchor_95_95"
  id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class=
  "fnanchor">[95]</a> To oppose this force Major-General Brock,
  whose head quarters were at Fort George, had under his immediate
  orders part of the 41st and 49th regiments, a few companies of
  militia, amounting to nearly half these regulars, and from 200 to
  300 Indians&mdash;in all about 1,500 men&mdash;but so dispersed
  in different <a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>posts at and
  between Fort Erie and Fort George, (34 miles apart,) that only a
  small number was quickly available at any one point. With
  unwearied diligence the British commander watched the motions of
  the enemy; but under these circumstances it was impossible to
  prevent the landing of the hostile troops, especially when their
  preparations were favored by the obscurity of the night.</p>

  <p>On the 9th of October, the brig Detroit, of 200 tons and 6
  guns, (lately the U.S. brig Adams,) and the North-West Company's
  brig Caledonia, of about 100 tons, having arrived the preceding
  day from Detroit, were boarded and carried opposite Fort Erie,
  before the dawn of day, by Lieutenant Elliott, of the American
  navy, with 100 seamen and soldiers in two large boats. This
  officer was at this time at Black Rock, superintending the
  equipment of some schooners, lately purchased for the service of
  Lake Erie. But for the <i>defensive</i> measures to which
  Major-General Brock was restricted, he would probably have
  destroyed these very schooners, for whose equipment, as vessels
  of war, Lieutenant Elliott and 50 seamen had been sent from New
  York. The two British brigs contained 40 prisoners, some cannon
  and small arms, captured at Detroit, exclusive of a valuable
  quantity of furs belonging to the North-West Company, in the
  Caledonia. Joined by the prisoners, the Americans who boarded
  numbered 140, and the crews of the two brigs, consisting of
  militia and Canadian seamen, amounted to 68. After the <a name=
  "Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>capture, Lieutenant Elliott
  succeeded in getting the Caledonia close under the batteries at
  Black Rock, but he was compelled, by a few well-directed shots
  from the Canada shore, to run the Detroit upon Squaw Island. Here
  she was boarded by a subaltern's detachment from Fort Erie, and
  the Americans soon after completed her destruction by setting her
  on fire. Some lives were lost upon this occasion, and among the
  Americans a Major Cuyler was killed by a shot from Fort Erie, as
  he was riding along the beach on the opposite side of the
  river.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Isaac Brock to Sir George Prevost</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>FORT GEORGE, October 11, 1812.</p>

    <p>I had scarcely closed my dispatch to your excellency, of the
    9th, when I was suddenly called away to Fort Erie, in
    consequence of a bold, and, I regret to say, successful attack
    by the enemy on his majesty's brig Detroit, and the private
    brig Caledonia, which had both arrived the preceding day from
    Amherstburg. It appears by every account I have been able to
    collect, that a little before day a number of boats full of
    men, dropped down with the current unobserved, boarded both
    vessels at the same moment, and, cutting their cables, were
    proceeding with them to the American shore, when Major Ormsby,
    who witnessed the transaction, directed the batteries to open
    on them, and soon compelled the enemy to abandon the Detroit,
    which grounded about the centre of <a name="Page_314" id=
    "Page_314"></a>Squaw Island, a little more than a mile below
    Black Rock. She was then boarded by a party of the 49th
    regiment; but as no anchor remained, and being otherwise
    unprovided with every means by which she could be hauled off,
    the officer, throwing her guns over board, after sustaining a
    smart fire of musketry, decided to quit her. A private, who is
    accused of getting drunk, and a prisoner of war, who was unable
    from his wounds to escape, with about twenty prisoners brought
    by the Detroit from Amherstburg, remained however behind; these
    it became necessary to remove before the vessel could be
    destroyed, and Cornet Pell Major, of the provincial cavalry,
    offered his services. Being unfortunately wounded as he was
    getting on board, and falling back into the boat, a confusion
    arose, during which the boat drifted from the vessel, leaving
    two of the 41st, who had previously ascended, on board. In the
    mean time the Caledonia was secured by the enemy, and a cargo
    of furs, belonging to the North-West Company, landed.</p>

    <p>The batteries on both sides were warmly engaged the whole of
    the day, but I am happy to say no mischief was sustained by the
    enemy's fire. I reached the spot soon after sun-set, and
    intended to have renewed the attempt to recover the Detroit,
    which I had <i>every</i> prospect of accomplishing, assisted by
    the crew of the Lady Prevost, which vessel had anchored a short
    time before; but before the necessary arrangements could be
    made, <a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>the enemy boarded
    her, and in a few minutes she was seen in flames.</p>

    <p>This event is particularly unfortunate, and may reduce us to
    incalculable distress. The enemy is making every exertion to
    gain a naval superiority on both lakes, which if they
    accomplish I do not see how we can retain the country. More
    vessels are fitting out for war on the other side of Squaw
    Island, which I should have attempted to destroy but for your
    excellency's repeated instructions to forbear. Now such a force
    is collected for their protection as will render every
    operation against them very hazardous. The manner our guns were
    served yesterday, points out the necessity of an increase, if
    possible, of artillerymen to our present small number of
    regulars. The militia evinced a good spirit, but fired without
    much effect. The enemy, however, must have lost some men; and
    it is only wonderful, that in a contest of a whole day no life
    was lost on our side. The fire of the enemy was incessant, but
    badly directed, till the close of the day, when it began to
    improve. Lieutenant Rolette, who commanded the Detroit, had,
    and I believe deservedly, the character of a brave, attentive
    officer. His vessel must, however, have been surprised&mdash;an
    easy operation where she lay at anchor; and I have reason to
    suspect that this consideration was not sufficiently attended
    to by the officers commanding on board and on shore.</p>

    <p>We have not only sustained a heavy loss in the <a name=
    "Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>vessel, but likewise in the cargo,
    which consisted of four 12-pounders, a large quantity of shot,
    and about 200 muskets, all of which were intended for Kingston
    and Prescott.</p>

    <p>The only consolation remaining is, that she escaped the
    enemy, whose conduct, after his first essay, did not entitle
    him to so rich a prize. The enemy has brought some boats over
    land from Schlosher to the Niagara river, and made an attempt
    last night to carry off the guard over the store at Queenston.
    I shall refrain as long as possible, under your excellency's
    positive injunctions, from every hostile act, although sensible
    that each day's delay gives him an advantage.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Sir Isaac Brock to Colonel Proctor, at Detroit</i>.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>The unfortunate disaster which has befallen the Detroit and
    Caledonia will reduce us to great distress. They were boarded
    whilst at anchor at Fort Erie and carried off: you will learn
    the particulars from others. A quantity of flour and a little
    pork were ready to be shipped for Amherstburg; but as I send
    you the flank companies of the Newfoundland, no part of the
    provisions can go this trip in the Lady Prevost. It will be
    necessary to direct her to return with all possible speed,
    bringing the Mary under her convoy. You will husband your pork,
    for I am sorry to say there is but little in the country.</p>

    <p>An active interesting scene is going to commence with you. I
    am perfectly at ease as to the <a name="Page_317" id=
    "Page_317"></a>result, provided we can manage the Indians and
    keep them attached to your cause, which in fact is theirs.</p>

    <p>The fate of the province is in your hands. Judging by every
    appearance, we are not to remain long idle in this quarter.
    Were it not for the positive injunctions of the commander of
    the forces, I should have acted with greater decision. This
    forbearance may be productive of ultimate good, but I doubt its
    policy&mdash;but perhaps we have not the means of judging
    correctly. You will of course adopt a very different line of
    conduct. The enemy must be kept in a state of constant ferment.
    If the Indians act as they did under Tecumseh, who probably
    might be induced to return to Amherstburg, that army will very
    soon dwindle to nothing. Your artillery must be more numerous
    and effective than any the enemy can bring, and your store of
    ammunition will enable you to harass him continually, without
    leaving much to chance.</p>

    <p>I trust you will have destroyed every barrack and public
    building, and removed the pickets and other defences around the
    fort at Detroit.</p>

    <p>You will have the goodness to state the expedients you
    possess to enable us to replace, as far as possible, the heavy
    loss we have sustained in the Detroit. Should I hear of
    reinforcements coming up, you may rely upon receiving your due
    proportion. Nothing new at Montreal on the 25th ult. Lord
    Wellington has totally defeated Marmont, <a name="Page_318" id=
    "Page_318"></a>near Salamanca. I consider the game nearly up in
    Spain. May every possible success attend you.</p>

    <p>The vast number of troops which have been this day added to
    the strong force previously collected on the opposite side,
    convinces me, with other indications, that an attack is not far
    distant. I have in consequence directed every exertion to be

    shall not be able to effect my object with willing,

    Americans in our ranks, we might defy all their efforts against
    this part of the province.</p>
  </div>

  <p>[The above letter is also from a copy written hurriedly by Sir
  Isaac Brock only a few hours before his death, and it may not

  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>A day or two prior to the battle of Queenstown, Major-General
  Brock wrote copious instructions for the guidance of the officers
  commanding at the different posts on the Niagara river, in the
  event of their being attacked, and he explained the probable
  points which he thought the enemy would select for accomplishing
  his descent. He evidently entertained a high opinion of the
  discipline and prowess of the British soldier, as in these
  instructions he observed: "If we weigh well the <a name=
  "Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>character of our enemy, we shall
  find him more disposed to brave the impediments of nature, when
  they afford him a probability of accomplishing his end by
  surprise, in preference to the certainty of encountering British
  troops ready formed for his reception." The original draft of
  these instructions in the general's writing, contains scarcely an
  erasure or correction.</p>

  <p>On the 4th of October, an American spy was sent to the British
  side, and returned with information that Major-General Brock had
  proceeded to Detroit with all the force that could be spared from
  the Niagara frontier. Encouraged by these false news, which
  perhaps the American general circulated to induce his troops to
  cross over, every preparation was made for a descent upon
  Queenstown. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy assembled a
  force at Lewistown, opposite to Queenstown, with the view of
  making an immediate attack on the latter, but, through some
  mismanagement in conducting the boats to the place of
  embarkation, the attack was delayed. Early on the morning of the
  13th, the enemy's troops were again concentrated and embarked in
  thirteen boats at Lewistown, under cover of a commanding battery
  of two 18 and two 6-pounders, which, with two field pieces,
  completely commanded every part of the opposite shore, from which
  musketry could be effectual in opposing a landing. The only
  British batteries from which the enemy could be annoyed in the
  passage were one, mount<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>ing
  an 18-pounder, upon Queenstown Heights, and another, mounting a
  24-pound carronade, situate a little below the village. Three of
  the boats put back, while the remaining ten, with 225 regulars,
  besides officers, struck the shore a little above the village of
  Queenstown, and immediately returned for more troops. The British
  force in Queenstown consisted of the two flank companies of the
  49th regiment and the York volunteer militia, amounting in all to
  about 300 rank and file. Of these about 60, taken from the 49th
  grenadiers, and Captain Hatt's company of militia, under Captain
  Dennis,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of the 49th, advanced
  at four o'clock, a.m., with a 3-pounder against the first
  division of the enemy, under Colonel Van Rensselaer, who had
  formed his men near the river, and was awaiting the arrival of
  the next boats. The Americans were driven with some loss behind a
  steep bank, close to the water's edge, where they were reinforced
  by a fresh supply of troops, and whence they returned the fire of
  the British. In the mean time the remainder of the 49th
  grenadiers and of the militia company joined Captain Dennis;
  while the 49th light company, under Captain Williams, with
  Captain Chisholm's company of militia, stationed on the brow of
  the hill, fired down upon the invaders.</p>

  <p>Sir Isaac Brock for some days had suspected this invasion, and
  the evening preceding it he <a name="Page_321" id=
  "Page_321"></a>called his staff together, and gave to each the
  necessary instructions. Agreeably to his usual custom, he rose
  before daylight, and hearing the cannonade, awoke Major Glegg and
  called for his horse, Alfred, which Sir James Craig had presented
  to him. He then gallopped eagerly from Fort George to the scene
  of action, and, with his two aides-de-camp, passed up the hill at
  full gallop in front of the light company, under a heavy fire of
  artillery and musketry from the American shore. On reaching the
  18-pounder battery at the top of the hill, they dismounted and
  took a view of passing events, which at that moment appeared
  highly favorable. But in a few minutes a firing was heard, which
  proceeded from a strong detachment of American regulars under
  Captain Wool, who had succeeded in gaining the brow of the
  heights in rear of the battery, by a fisherman's path up the
  rocks, which, being reported as impassable, was not guarded. Sir
  Isaac Brock and his aide-de-camps had not even time to remount,
  but were obliged to retire precipitately with the twelve men
  stationed in the battery, which was quickly occupied by the
  enemy. Captain Wool having sent forward about 150 regulars,
  Captain Williams' detachment, of about 100 men, advanced to meet
  them, personally directed by the general, who, observing the
  enemy to waver, ordered a charge, which was promptly executed;
  but as the Americans gave way, the result was not equal to his
  expectations. Captain Wool admits <a name="Page_322" id=
  "Page_322"></a>that he reinforced his regulars, "notwithstanding
  which the whole were driven to the edge of the bank."<a name=
  "FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Here some of the
  American officers were on the point of hoisting a white flag,
  with an intention to surrender, when Captain Wool tore it off,
  and reanimated his dispirited troops. They now opened a heavy
  fire of musketry; and conspicuous from his dress, his height, and
  the enthusiasm with which he animated his little band, the
  British commander was soon singled out, and he fell about an hour
  after his arrival, the fatal bullet entering his right breast and
  passing through his left side. He had that instant said: "Push on
  the York volunteers;" and he lived only long enough to request
  that his fall might not be noticed or prevent the advance of his
  brave troops, adding a wish, which could not be distinctly
  understood, that some token of remembrance should be transmitted
  to his sister. He died unmarried, and on the same day a week
  previously, he had completed his forty-third year. The lifeless
  corpse was immediately conveyed into a house at Queenstown, where
  it remained until the afternoon unperceived by the enemy. His
  provincial aide-de-camp, Lieut.-Colonel M'Donell, of the militia,
  and the attorney-general of Upper Canada&mdash;a fine promising
  young man&mdash;was mortally wounded soon after his chief, and
  died the next day, at the early age of twenty-five years.
  Although one bullet had passed through his body, and he was
  <a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>wounded in four places, yet
  he survived twenty hours; and during a period of excruciating
  agony, his thoughts and words were constantly occupied with
  lamentations for his deceased commander and friend. He fell while
  gallantly charging up the hill with 190 men, chiefly of the York
  volunteers, by which charge the enemy was compelled to spike the
  18-pounder in the battery there.</p>

  <p>The flank companies of the 49th having suffered severely, and
  both their captains being wounded, the disputed ground was lost
  soon after the death of the general, and the troops retreated in
  front of Vromont's battery, where they awaited the expected
  reinforcements. The Americans remained in quiet possession of the
  heights of Queenstown for some hours, during which they were but
  partially reinforced, as their militia, who a day or two before
  were so anxious to invade Canada&mdash;having heard from the
  wounded men sent back what they must expect if they came in
  contact with the 49th, "the green tigers," as they called them
  from their green facings&mdash;could not now be induced, either
  by threat or entreaty, to cross the river. Indeed, the flank
  companies of the 49th, in the excitement arising from the loss of
  their late beloved colonel, are said to have fought with such
  animosity throughout the day, as to have fully supported this new
  title. In the meanwhile, Major-General Sheaffe arrived from Fort
  George<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> with nearly 400
  <a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>of the 41st regiment, under
  Captain Derenzy and about 300 militia; and&mdash;after being
  joined by the remnant of the 49th flank companies and the
  Indians, and leaving two field pieces with 30 men in front of
  Queenstown, to prevent its occupation by the Americans&mdash;he
  proceeded by a circuitous route to gain the rear of the heights
  upon which the enemy was posted. Here he was reinforced by the
  arrival of the 41st grenadiers and some militia from Chippewa,
  the whole of the British and Indian force thus assembled rather
  exceeding 1,000 men, of whom about 600 were regulars. In numbers
  the Americans were about equal&mdash;courage they had, but they
  wanted the confidence and discipline of British soldiers.</p>

  <p>The attack commenced in the afternoon, and after a little
  firing, the British, setting up a shout which was accompanied by
  the war-whoop of the Indians, advanced at the double quick or
  running pace, when the Americans, perceiving the hopelessness of
  resistance, fled down the hill after a feeble contest. The
  slaughter was unhappily protracted, because the Indians could not
  at first be restrained. The Americans, who attempted to escape
  into the woods, were quickly driven back by the Indians; and
  many, cut off in their return to the main body, and terrified at
  the sight of these exasperated warriors, flung themselves wildly
  over the cliffs, and endeavoured to cling to the bushes which
  grew upon them; but some, losing their hold, were dashed
  frightfully on the rocks <a name="Page_325" id=
  "Page_325"></a>beneath; while others, who reached the river,
  perished in their attempts to swim across it. Such, alas! are the
  dreadful horrors too often arising from human warfare! A flag of
  truce soon came from the American commander, with the offer of an
  unconditional surrender, and Brigadier Wadsworth, with upwards of
  900 officers and men, were made prisoners. The death of the
  British general is said to have cost the invaders many a life on
  that day, which otherwise had been spared. Their loss was 90
  killed and about 100 wounded, while that of the British and
  Indians was 16 killed and 69 wounded. The victory, though easily
  won, was complete; but it was felt by the conquerors as a poor
  compensation for the loss of the British chieftain, thus
  prematurely cut off in the pride of manhood and in the noon-tide
  of his career; while the sorrow manifested throughout both
  provinces proved that those who rejoiced in the failure of this
  second invasion, would gladly have foregone the triumph, if by
  such means they could have regained him who rendered the heights
  of Queenstown memorable by his fall.</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Joy's bursting shout in
  whelming grief was drowned,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Victory's self unwilling
  audience found;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">On every brow the cloud of
  sadness hung,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sounds of triumph died on
  every tongue!</span><br /></p>

  <p>"The news of the death of this excellent officer," observed
  the Quebec Gazette, "has been received here as a public calamity.
  The attendant circumstances of victory scarcely checked the
  painful sensation. His long residence in this province, <a name=
  "Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>and particularly in this place, had
  made him in habits and good offices almost a citizen; and his
  frankness, conciliatory disposition, and elevated demeanour, an
  estimable one. The expressions of regret as general as he was
  known, and not uttered by friends and acquaintance only, but by
  every gradation of class, not only by grown persons, but young
  children, are the test of his worth. Such too is the only
  eulogium worthy of the good and brave, and the citizens of Quebec
  have, with solemn emotions, pronounced it on his memory. But at
  this anxious moment other feelings are excited by his loss.
  General Brock had acquired the confidence of the inhabitants
  within his government. He had secured their attachment
  permanently by his own merits. They were one people animated by
  one disposition, and this he had gradually wound up to the crisis
  in which they were placed. Strange as it may seem, it is to be
  feared that he had become too important to them. The heroic
  militia of Upper Canada, more particularly, had knit themselves
  to his person; and it is yet to be ascertained whether the desire
  to avenge his death can compensate the many embarrassments it
  will occasion. It is indeed true that the spirit, and even the
  abilities, of a distinguished man often carry their influence
  beyond the grave; and the present event furnishes its own
  example, for it is certain, notwithstanding General Brock was cut
  off early in the action, that he had already given an impulse to
  his little army, which contri<a name="Page_327" id=
  "Page_327"></a>buted to accomplish the victory when he was no
  more. Let us trust that the recollection of him will become a new
  bond of union, and that, as he sacrificed himself for a community
  of patriots, they will find a new motive to exertion in the
  obligation to secure his ashes from the pestilential dominion of
  the enemy."</p>

  <p>A Montreal newspaper of the day also contained the following
  observations: "The private letters from Upper Canada, in giving
  the account of the late victory at Queenstown, are partly taken
  up with encomiastic lamentations upon the never-to-be-forgotten
  General Brock, which do honor to the character and talents of the
  man they deplore. The enemy have nothing to hope from the loss
  they have inflicted; they have created a hatred which panteth for
  revenge. Although General Brock may be said to have fallen in the
  midst of his career, yet his previous services in Upper Canada
  will be lasting and highly beneficial. When he assumed the
  government of the province, he found a divided, disaffected, and,
  of course, a weak people. He has left them united and strong, and
  the universal sorrow of the province attends his fall. The
  father, to his children, will make known the mournful story. The
  veteran, who fought by his side in the heat and burthen of the
  day of our deliverance, will venerate his name."<a name=
  "FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

  <p><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>And the sentiments of the
  British government, on the melancholy occasion, were thus
  expressed in a dispatch from Earl Bathurst, the secretary of
  state for the colonies, to Sir George Prevost, dated December 8,
  1812: "His royal highness the prince regent is fully aware of the
  severe loss which his majesty's service has experienced in the
  death of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock. This would have been
  sufficient to have clouded a victory of much greater importance.
  His majesty has lost in him not only an able and meritorious
  officer, but one who, in the exercise of his functions of
  provisional lieutenant-governor of the province, displayed
  qualities admirably adapted to awe the disloyal, to reconcile the
  wavering, and to animate the great mass of the inhabitants
  against successive attempts of the enemy to invade the province,
  in the last of which he unhappily fell, too prodigal of that life
  of which his eminent services had taught us to understand the
  value."</p>

  <p>The Montreal Herald of April 29, 1815, blames Sir George
  Prevost for having suppressed, in his general order, much of the
  preceding letter from Lord Bathurst, and remarks: "We repeat that
  the said letter was not published to the army or to the public, a
  part of which the latter ought to have known, because the
  sentiments expressed by the prince are those of the loyal people
  of Upper Canada, who would be glad to have seen them soon after
  the official letter arrived in Canada." The following was
  substituted for this letter in a <a name="Page_329" id=
  "Page_329"></a>general order of the late commander-in-chief,
  dated the 10th March, 1813, said to have been published to the
  army at the time of its date:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>'His royal highness is fully aware of the severe loss which
    his majesty's service has experienced in the death of
    Major-General Sir Isaac Brock.'</p>
  </div>

  <p>"But we have been told that even the said general order was
  not known to some regiments of the right division, until it
  appeared in the Quebec Gazette of the 20th instant." And
  "considering the character of the distinguished chief who fell on
  the British side at the Queenstown battle,"<a name=
  "FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> we certainly do
  not think that Lord Bathurst intended his dispatch, relative to
  that officer's death, should have been thus mutilated or
  suppressed in the Canadas.</p>

  <p>The Canadian boat songs are well known for their plaintive and
  soothing effect, and a very beautiful one was composed on the
  death of Major-General Brock. The writer of this memoir, while
  sailing one evening in the straits of Canso, in British North
  America&mdash;the beautiful and picturesque scenery of which
  greatly increased the effect of the words&mdash;remembers to have
  heard it sung by a Canadian boatman, and he then thought that he
  had never listened to vocal sounds more truly descriptive of
  melancholy and regret. Even the young in Canada invoked the Muse
  in expression of their sympathy, and the following lines were
  indited by Miss Ann Bruyeres, described as "<a name="Page_330"
  id="Page_330"></a>an extraordinary child of thirteen years old,"
  the daughter of the general's friend, Lieut.-Colonel. Bruyeres,
  of the Royal Engineers, (see page <a href='#Page_213'>213</a>,)
  and who died not long after him in consequence of disease
  contracted in the field:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">As Fame alighted on the
  mountain's<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id=
  "FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class=
  "fnanchor">[101]</a> crest,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">She loudly blew her trumpet's
  mighty blast;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ere she repeated Victory's notes,
  she cast</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">A look around, and stopped: of
  power bereft,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her bosom heaved, her breath she
  drew with pain,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her favorite Brock lay
  slaughtered on the plain!</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glory threw on his grave a laurel
  wreath,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Fame proclaims "a hero sleeps
  beneath."</span><br /></p>

  <p>As if to complete the double allusion to Fame in the preceding
  lines, singularly enough the mournful intelligence of Sir Isaac
  Brock's death was brought from Quebec to Guernsey by the ship
  FAME, belonging to that island, on the 24th November, two days
  before it was known in London.</p>

  <p>Sir Isaac Brock, after lying in state at the government house,
  where his body was bedewed with the tears of many affectionate
  friends, was interred on the 16th of October, with his provincial
  aide-de-camp, at Fort George. His surviving aide-de-camp, Major
  Glegg, recollecting the decided aversion of the general to every
  thing that bore the appearance of ostentatious display,
  endeavoured to clothe the distressing ceremony with all his
  "native simplicity." But at the same time there were military
  honors that could not be avoided, and the following was the order
  of the <a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>mournful
  procession,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id=
  "FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class=
  "fnanchor">[102]</a> "of which," wrote Major Glegg, "I enclose a
  plan; but no pen can describe the real scenes of that mournful
  day. A more solemn and affecting spectacle was perhaps never
  witnessed. As every arrangement connected with that afflicting
  ceremony fell to my lot, a second attack being hourly expected,
  and the minds of all being fully occupied with the duties of
  their respective stations, I anxiously endeavoured to perform
  this last tribute of affection in a manner corresponding with the
  elevated virtues of my departed patron. Conceiving that an
  interment in every respect military would be the most appropriate
  to the character of our dear friend, I made choice of a cavalier
  bastion in Fort George, which his aspiring genius had lately
  suggested, and which had been just finished under his daily
  superintendence."</p>

  <p>Such was the esteem in which Sir Isaac Brock was held by the
  enemies of his country, for he had <a name="Page_333" id=
  "Page_333"></a>or could have no personal enemies, that
  Major-General Van Rensselaer, in a letter of condolence, informed
  Major-General Sheaffe that immediately after the funeral
  solemnities were over on the British side, a compliment of minute
  guns would be paid to the hero's memory on theirs!!! Accordingly,
  the cannon at Fort Niagara were fired, "as a mark of respect due
  to a brave enemy." How much is it then to be regretted that we
  should ever come into collision with those who possess the same
  origin and the same language as ourselves, and who, by this
  generous feeling and conduct, proved that they are a liberal, as
  they undoubtedly are a gallant, people; and may the future
  rivalry of both powers be, not for the unnatural destruction of
  each other, but for the benefit of mankind. No words can better
  express the favorable opinion entertained by the Americans of the
  deceased than the language of their president, Madison, who,
  alluding to the battle of Queenstown in his annual message to
  congress, observed: "Our loss has been considerable, and is
  deeply to be lamented. That of the enemy, less ascertained, will
  be the more felt, as it includes amongst the killed the
  commanding general, who was also the governor of the
  province."</p>

  <p>Ere we proceed to delineate the person and character of this
  able soldier and excellent man, we shall transcribe the sketches
  of two strangers,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id=
  "FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class=
  "fnanchor">[104]</a> <a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>lest
  the portrait of a relative should be deemed too highly coloured.
  That portrait has been drawn by them with a master hand,
  especially the first; and although feelingly alive to our
  incompetency for the task, we also must endeavour, with a
  trembling pen, to do justice to the memory of the hero.</p>

  <p>"Thus ended in their total discomfiture," says Christie in his
  Historical Memoirs, already cited, "the second attempt of the
  Americans to invade Upper Canada. The loss of the British is said
  to have been about 20 killed, including Indians, and between 50
  and 60 wounded. The fall of General Brock, the idol of the army
  and of the people of Upper Canada, was an irreparable loss, and
  cast a shade over the glory of this dear-bought victory. He was a
  native of Guernsey, of an ancient and reputable family,
  distinguished in the profession of arms. He had served for many
  years in Canada, and in some of the principal campaigns in
  Europe. He commanded a detachment of his favorite 49th regiment,
  on the expedition to Copenhagen with Lord Nelson, where he
  distinguished himself. He was one of those extraordinary men who
  seem born to influence mankind, and mark the age in which they
  live. Conscious of the ascendancy of his genius over those who
  surrounded him, he blended the mildest of manners with the
  severity and discipline of a camp; and though his deportment was
  somewhat grave and imposing, the noble frankness of his character
  imparted at once confidence and respect to those who had occasion
  to <a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>approach his person. As a
  soldier, he was brave to a fault, and not less judicious than
  decisive in his measures. The energy of his character was
  strongly expressed in his countenance, and in the robust and
  manly symmetry of his frame. As a civil governor, he was firm,
  prudent, and equitable. In fine, whether we view him as a man, a
  statesman, or a soldier, he equally deserves the esteem and
  respect of his contemporaries and of posterity. The Indians who
  flocked to his standard were attached to him with almost
  enthusiastic affection, and the enemy even expressed an
  involuntary regret at his untimely fall. His prodigality of life
  bereft the country of his services at the early age of forty-two
  years. The remains of this gallant officer were, during the
  funeral service, honored with a discharge of minute guns from the
  American, as well as the British, batteries, and with those of
  his faithful aide-de-camp, Lieut.-Colonel M'Donell, were interred
  in the same grave at Fort George, on the 16th October, amidst the
  tears of an affectionate soldiery and a grateful people, who will
  cherish his memory with veneration, and hand to their posterity
  the imperishable name of BROCK."</p>

  <p>"General Brock was killed at the battle of Queenstown
  heights," observes Howison in his Sketches of Upper Canada, "and
  the place where he fell was pointed out to me. The Canadians hold
  the memory of this brave and excellent man in great veneration,
  but have not yet attempted to <a name="Page_336" id=
  "Page_336"></a>testify their respect for his virtues in any way,
  except by shewing to strangers the spot on which he received his
  mortal wound. He was more popular, and more beloved by the
  inhabitants of Upper Canada, than any man they ever had among
  them, and with reason; for he possessed, in an eminent degree,
  those virtues which add lustre to bravery, and those talents that
  shine alike in the cabinet and in the field. His manners and
  dispositions were so conciliating as to gain the affection of all
  whom he commanded, while his innate nobleness and dignity of mind
  secured him a respect almost amounting to veneration. He is now
  styled the Hero of Upper Canada, and, had he lived, there is no
  doubt but the war would have terminated very differently from
  what it did. The Canadian farmers are not over-burthened with
  sensibility, yet I have seen several of them shed tears when an
  eulogium was pronounced upon the immortal and generous-minded
  deliverer of their country.</p>

  <p>"General Brock was killed close to the road that leads through
  Queenstown village, and an aged thorn bush now marks the place
  where he fell, when the fatal ball entered his vitals. This spot
  may be called classic ground, for a view of it must awaken in the
  minds of all those who duly appreciate the greatness of his
  character, and are acquainted with the nature of his resources
  and exertions, feelings as warm and enthusiastic as the
  contemplation of monuments consecrated by antiquity can ever
  do."</p>

  <p><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>Nature had been very
  bountiful to Sir Isaac Brock in those personal gifts which appear
  to such peculiar advantage in the army, and at the first glance
  the soldier and the gentleman were seen. In stature he was
  tall,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id=
  "FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class=
  "fnanchor">[105]</a> erect, athletic, and well proportioned,
  although in his latter years his figure was perhaps too portly;
  and when a young man, at the head of his company of grenadiers,
  he attracted general observation by his martial presence. His
  fine and benevolent countenance was a perfect index of his mind,
  and his manners were courteous, frank, and engaging. Brave,
  liberal, and humane; devoted to his sovereign, and loving his
  country with romantic fondness; in command so gentle and
  persuasive, yet so firm, that he possessed the rare faculty of
  acquiring both the respect and the attachment of all who served
  under him. When urged by some friends, shortly before his death,
  to be more careful of his person, he replied: "How can I expect
  my men to go where I am afraid to lead them;" and although
  perhaps his anxiety ever to shew a good example, by being
  foremost in danger, induced him to expose himself more than
  strict prudence or formality warranted, yet, if he erred on this
  point, his error was that of a soldier.<a name="FNanchor_106_106"
  id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class=
  "fnanchor">[106]</a> Elevated to the government <a name=
  "Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>of Upper Canada, he reclaimed many
  of the disaffected by mildness, and fixed the wavering by the
  argument of success; and having no national partialities to
  gratify, that rock on which so many provincial governors have
  split, he meted equal favor and justice to all, British born
  subjects soon felt convinced that with him their religion or
  their birth-place was no obstacle to their advancement. Even over
  the minds of the Indians Sir Isaac Brock gained, at and after the
  capture of Detroit, an ascendancy altogether unexampled, and
  which he judiciously exercised for purposes conducive equally to
  the cause of humanity and to the interests of his country. He
  engaged them to throw aside the scalping knife, implanted in
  their breasts the virtues of clemency and forbearance, and taught
  them to feel pleasure and pride in the compassion extended to a
  vanquished enemy. In return they revered him as their common
  father, and while under his command were guilty of no
  excesses.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id=
  "FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class=
  "fnanchor">[107]</a> It is well known that this untutored people,
  the children of the forests, value personal much more highly than
  mental qualities, but the union of both in their leader was
  happily calculated to impress their haughty and masculine minds
  with respect and admiration; and the <a name="Page_339" id=
  "Page_339"></a>speech delivered by Tecumseh, after the capture of
  Detroit, is illustrative of the sentiments with which he had
  inspired these warlike tribes. "I have heard," observed that
  chief to him, "much of your fame, and am happy again to shake by
  the hand a brave brother warrior. The Americans endeavour to give
  us a mean opinion of British generals, but we have been the
  witnesses of your valour. In crossing the river to attack the
  enemy, we observed you from a distance standing the whole time in
  an erect posture, and, when the boats reached the shore, you were
  among the first who jumped on land. Your bold and sudden
  movements frightened the enemy, and you compelled them to
  surrender to half their own force."</p>

  <p>Of all the good qualities which adorned this accomplished
  soldier none was more prominent than his decision, and it was
  ever under the guidance of a sound judgment. His strong
  attachment to the service, and particularly to his regiment,
  formed another distinguishing feature in his character. A very
  gallant officer, who still survives, is not ashamed to confess
  his pecuniary obligations to Colonel Brock while he was a
  subaltern in the 49th, and rendered, as he states, doubly
  valuable by the manner in which assistance was afforded to him in
  his difficulties. When, as Colonel Brock, he had secured the
  ringleaders of the intended mutiny at Fort George, as related in
  the second chapter, he ordered the detachment to the parade,
  where he proceeded to address them on <a name="Page_340" id=
  "Page_340"></a>the enormity of their offence; but when he began
  to express his grief and shame at their conduct, he was so
  affected as to be utterly unable to continue. The men were
  equally moved, and are said to have exclaimed: "Had you commanded
  us, Sir, this never would have occurred." Indeed, there was a
  correspondence of regard between him and his officers, and even
  the non-commissioned officers and privates, that, with this
  solitary exception, produced the picture of a happy family. Those
  extremities of punishment, which the exactions of discipline will
  sometimes occasion, rarely reached his men. And yet shortly
  before he succeeded to the command of the regiment, it was in a
  sad state of disorganization, from the causes already explained.
  (Page 7.) During the mutiny on board the fleet at the Nore, in
  May, 1797, the 49th was quartered on the borders of the river
  Thames; and as the privates evidently sympathized with the
  seamen, Major Brock not only seldom went to bed till nearly
  daylight, but slept with loaded pistols, while during the day he
  frequently visited the mess-rooms, to tear down or erase such
  inscriptions as "The Navy for Ever." But soon after he became the
  lieutenant-colonel, by happily blending conciliation with
  firmness, and bringing to a court martial two or three officers,
  whose misconduct could not be overlooked, he quickly restored the
  discipline of the corps. Having effected this, he afterwards
  governed it by that sentiment of esteem which he himself had
  created, and the <a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>consolation
  was given him to terminate a brief but brilliant course in the
  midst of his professional family.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id=
  "FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class=
  "fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

  <p>It deserves to be recorded as an instance of good fortune,
  unprecedented perhaps in military annals, and especially in a
  country where the advantage and facility of escape were so great,
  that from the 6th of August, the day on which Major-General Brock
  left York for Detroit, to the period immediately preceding the
  battle of Queenstown, the force under his personal command
  suffered no diminution in its numbers either by desertion,
  natural death, or the sword. This comprehended a period of nearly
  ten weeks, during which an army was captured, and a journey of
  several hundred miles, by land and water, accomplished with
  extreme rapidity.</p>

  <p>In compiling this memoir, we have been much struck with the
  rapidity of Major-General Brock's movements: he appears to have
  been everywhere, and, as Veritas observed of him, to have "flown,
  as it were." To-day at York, engaged in his civil and military
  duties&mdash;to-morrow at Fort George, superintending the
  defences of the Niagara frontier, or at Kingston, reviewing and
  animating the militia. To-day at Fort George, watching the
  enemy&mdash;the next at York, dissolving the
  legislature&mdash;and a fortnight after, on his return from the
  <a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>capture of Detroit! To-day
  at Fort George again&mdash;a few hours after at Fort Erie,
  endeavouring to retake the brigs Detroit and Caledonia. And yet
  this most active and energetic officer was compelled, by his
  <i>defensive</i> instructions, tamely to look on the
  <i>offensive</i> preparations of the Americans for the invasion
  of the province committed to his charge!</p>

  <p>In conclusion, it is due to the memory of this excellent man
  to declare that, eminent and undisputed as were his public
  virtues, he was no less estimable in private life. In his own
  family he was the object of the warmest affection, and his
  servants carefully preserved relics of their dear master, as they
  styled him to their dying day. His cares and anxieties had no
  reference to the wealth he should amass, but to the sum of human
  misery he might relieve; and towards the close of his brief
  career, as the prospect of increasing honors and emoluments
  opened to his view, he contemplated his good fortune only as the
  means of diffusing felicity, of drying the tear of affliction.
  Indeed, so totally devoid was he of every mercenary
  consideration, that although he enjoyed an ample income from his
  appointments,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id=
  "FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class=
  "fnanchor">[109]</a> by which at least the purchase of his
  commissions might have been repaid, yet he left literally nothing
  but his fair name behind him. Some of his nearest relatives have
  since been cut off more prematurely, and far <a name="Page_343"
  id="Page_343"></a>more cruelly, than himself; but those who still
  survive him possess the never-failing consolation which arises
  from the remembrance of his virtues, and from the reflection
  that, though his blessed spirit fled early from this world, they
  may meet again in the mansions of futurity.</p>

  <p>Though the dead heed not human praise, yet the living act
  wisely in commemorating the fall of a distinguished
  chief&mdash;the example is never thrown away&mdash;and on this
  occasion it is gratifying to reflect, that every posthumous honor
  was paid to the memory of one who had merited the distinction so
  well. A public monument,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id=
  "FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class=
  "fnanchor">[110]</a> having been decreed by the imperial
  parliament, was raised a few years since in St. Paul's, and a
  view of it is said to have awakened in an astonished Indian more
  surprise and admiration than any thing he witnessed in
  England.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id=
  "FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class=
  "fnanchor">[111]</a> In consequence of an address<a name=
  "FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> from the commons
  of Upper Canada to the prince regent, a munificent grant of
  12,000 acres of land in that province was bestowed on the four
  surviving brothers of Sir Isaac Brock, who, in addition, were
  allowed a pension of &pound;200 a year for life, by a vote of the
  imperial parliament. To "the hero of Upper Canada," as he is
  still termed in that country, the provincial legislature erected
  a lofty column<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id=
  "FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class=
  "fnanchor">[113]</a> on Queenstown heights, <a name="Page_344"
  id="Page_344"></a>to which his remains, and those of his gallant
  aide-de-camp, were removed from Fort George in solemn procession,
  on the 13th of October, 1824.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id=
  "FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class=
  "fnanchor">[114]</a> Although twelve years had elapsed since the
  interment, the body of the general had undergone little change,
  his features being nearly perfect and easily recognized, while
  that of Lieut.-Colonel M'Donell was in a complete mass of
  decomposition. One of his regimental companions, Colonel
  Fitzgibbon, in transmitting a detail of the ceremonies of the
  day, thus pathetically expressed himself: "Nothing, certainly,
  could exceed the interest manifested by the people of the
  province upon the occasion; and numbers from the neighbouring
  state of New York, by their presence and conduct, proved how
  highly the Americans revere the memory of our lamented chief. Of
  the thousands present not one had cause to feel so deeply as I,
  and I felt as if alone, although surrounded by the multitude. He
  had been more than a father to me in that regiment which he ruled
  like a father, and I alone of his old friends in that regiment
  was present to embalm with a tear his last honored retreat. What
  I witnessed on this day would have fully confirmed me in the
  opinion, had confirmation been wanting, that the public feeling
  in this province has been permanently improved and elevated by
  Sir Isaac Brock's conduct and actions while governing its
  inhabitants. These, together with his dying in their defence,
  have done more towards cementing <a name="Page_345" id=
  "Page_345"></a>our union with the mother country than any event
  or circumstance since the existence of the province. Of this our
  leading men are aware, and are careful to seize every opportunity
  of preserving recollections so productive of good effects." The
  height of the column,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id=
  "FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class=
  "fnanchor">[115]</a> which commanded a view of the surrounding
  country for about fifty miles, was from the base to the summit
  135 feet, and from the level of the Niagara river, which runs
  nearly under it, 485 feet. The following inscription was engraven
  on this splendid tribute to the unfading remembrance of a
  grateful people:<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id=

  <p><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>The cataract of Niagara
  is supposed to have commenced on the heights of Queenstown, and
  to have gradually receded, or worn its way backwards to its
  present site, seven miles above, near Chippewa, the banks of the
  river on both sides between the two spots being perpendicular, 2
  to 300 feet in height, chiefly of solid rock, and of the same
  level as the fall.</p>

  <p>"The village of Queenstown is beautifully situated at the foot
  of a hill, and upon the side of the Niagara river, the bank of
  which is high and precipitous. The imagination is agreeably
  struck with the first view of the place. On one side of the
  village is a mountain covered with shrubbery and
  verdure;&mdash;behind, a rich and cultivated plain extends
  backwards, which is bounded in every direction by luxuriant
  woods; while in front, the Niagara river glides in majestic
  stillness, and may be traced, with all its windings, till its
  waters are swallowed up in the vast expanse of Lake Ontario. The
  soil around Queenstown consists chiefly of a red clay, the bright
  colour of which, upon the roads and declivities where it is
  exposed, forms a singular contrast, during summer, with the pure
  green of the trees and fields in the vicinity.</p>

  <p>"Queenstown must infallibly acquire magnitude and importance
  when the province becomes populous and flourishing, for it is
  situated at the commencement of a portage, which never can be
  evaded by any improvement in the navigation, it being rendered
  necessary by the falls of Niagara; <a name="Page_347" id=
  "Page_347"></a>therefore, all vessels containing goods and stores
  destined for the western parts of Upper Canada must unload and
  leave their cargoes at Queenstown, that they may be conveyed
  overland to Chippewa, where the Niagara river again becomes
  navigable. Even now, a good deal of this carrying business goes
  on during the summer months. The North-West Company forward a
  considerable quantity of stores to the Indian territories by this
  route, and the country merchants receive annual supplies of goods
  from Montreal, and send down pork, flour, staves, and potash, in
  return.</p>

  <p>"The environs of Queenstown are beautifully picturesque and
  romantic, and nothing can be finer than the prospect up the
  Niagara river. Immediately above the village its channel narrows
  very much, and the banks rise to the height of 300 feet
  perpendicular, while at the same time they become wild and rocky,
  and are thickly covered with trees of various kinds. In some
  places they partly over-arch the river, and throw an appalling
  gloom upon its waters, now dashed into turbulence and impetuosity
  by the ruggedness of their sloping bed.</p>

  <p>"At the ferry, the Niagara river is 1,250 feet in breadth, and
  from 2 to 300 in depth. The current is very rapid, and the
  wreathing and perturbed appearance of the water shews that its
  course is much impeded by the narrowness of the channel, which
  must be entirely composed of rocks; for, otherwise, the continual
  and rapid attrition of such a large river as that which flows
  <a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>through it, would undermine
  and wear away the banks, and thus gradually enlarge and widen its
  course.</p>

  <p>"The prospect from the top of Queenstown mountain is the
  finest and most extensive that Upper Canada affords, and, in an
  eminent degree, combines the beautiful and the magnificent. The
  wild and majestic precipices which engulf one part of the Niagara
  river, the windings and mirrored expanse of that noble body of
  water, the dim and undiscoverable extent of Lake Ontario,
  together with the verdant orchards, thick forests, and improved
  fields, glowing beneath a pure sky, collectively form a scene of
  admirable effect and composition. Even York, which is 36 miles
  distant, and lies very low, can be seen from the summit of this
  hill during clear weather."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id=

  <p>Sir Isaac Brock was succeeded in his civil and military
  commands in Upper Canada by Major-General Sheaffe, who was
  created a baronet for the dearly bought victory of Queenstown.
  After the battle, he paroled General Wadsworth and some of the
  principal American officers, the remainder proceeding to Quebec.
  Among the prisoners, 23 were found to be deserters from English
  regiments, and British born subjects; and they were sent to
  England for trial as traitors. This caused a retaliation upon
  British prisoners in the United States, and an equal number were
  put by the American government into close confinement as hostages
  for the security of the traitors.</p>

  <p>On the 18th of October, General Smyth assumed the command at
  Niagara, and applied to the British general for an armistice; and
  notwithstanding the well-known prejudicial effect of the former
  one proposed by Sir George Prevost, it was agreed to by
  Major-General Sheaffe!<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id=
  "FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class=
  "fnanchor">[118]</a> This unaccountable proceeding, as might
  easily have been foreseen, <a name="Page_350" id=
  "Page_350"></a>proved of material detriment to the British on
  Lake Erie, as the Americans availed themselves of so favorable an
  occasion to forward their naval stores unmolested from Black Rock
  to Presqu'&icirc;le by water, which they could not otherwise have
  effected, but with immense trouble and expense by land, and
  equipped at leisure the fleet which afterwards wrested from us
  the command of that lake. When the enemy was prepared for a third
  invasion of Upper Canada, General Smyth did not fail to give the
  thirty hours notice required for the cessation of the armistice,
  which terminated on the 20th of November.</p>

  <p>"After the surrender of Detroit," said the inhabitants of
  Niagara in their spirited letter to Sir George Prevost, already
  quoted (page <a href='#Page_279'>279</a>), "the enemy were
  suffered unmolested to concentrate a large force on the Niagara,
  at Sackett's Harbour on Lake Ontario, and at Ogdensburg on the
  St. Lawrence; they were not interrupted in bringing forward to
  these places a large quantity of field and heavy artillery, with
  the requisite supplies of ammunition, and in equipping a
  flotilla, to dispute with us the superiority of the lakes. When
  their preparations were complete&mdash;when our regular and
  militia forces were nearly exhausted with incessant watching and
  fatigue, occasioned by the movements of the enemy, which kept
  them constantly on the alert by uncertainty as to the point of
  attack&mdash;they at length, on the 13th of October, attacked our
  line at Queenstown. The behaviour <a name="Page_351" id=
  "Page_351"></a>of both regulars and militia on that memorable
  occasion is well known to your excellency, and added another
  wreath to the laurels they had gained at Detroit: the glories of
  that day were, however, obscured by the death of our beloved and
  now lamented chief, whose exertions had prepared the means of
  achieving this great victory. This was another triumph for the
  militia; they had fairly measured their strength with the enemy,
  and derived additional confidence from the glorious result. Here
  was another opportunity that slipped away without being improved:
  Fort Niagara was abandoned by the enemy, and might have been with
  the greatest ease destroyed, and its guns brought away by a
  trifling force. It is neither necessary, nor do we feel inclined
  to enter into the causes why it was not done; we have, however,
  the strongest reason to believe that, had General Brock survived,
  it would have been attempted. In addition to this (as we consider
  it) capital error, Major Mullaney, and other natural born
  subjects of his majesty, actually taken in arms as commissioned
  officers in the service of the United States, were released and
  allowed to return on parole to that country; and a partial
  armistice was agreed to, liable to be broken off at thirty hours
  notice, which could be productive of no real advantage to us, nor
  give any repose to our harassed and suffering militia, though it
  enabled the enemy to recruit his strength and organize at will
  the means of attacking us anew. He was observed <a name=
  "Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>busily and actively employed,
  throughout a great part of the month of November, collecting
  boats on the Fort Erie end of the line; and when his preparations
  were complete, he gave notice of the termination of the armistice
  on the 20th."</p>

  <p>"When General Wilkinson complains," observes the British
  historian James, "that the executive has not rendered 'common
  justice to the principal actors in this gallant scene,'&mdash;not
  exhibited it to the country 'in its true light, and shewn what
  deeds Americans are still capable of performing,'<a name=
  "FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;who among us
  can retain his gravity? 'It is true,' says the general, 'complete
  success did not ultimately crown this enterprise; but two great
  ends were obtained for the country: it re-established the
  character of the American arms;'&mdash;it did indeed!&mdash;'and
  deprived the enemy, by the death of General Brock, of the best
  officer that has headed their troops in Canada throughout the
  war;'&mdash;truth undeniable!&mdash;'and, with his loss, put an
  end to their then brilliant career;'&mdash;yet the capture of
  General Wadsworth took place in less than five hours
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>"The instant we know what the Americans expected to gain, a
  tolerable idea may be formed of what they actually lost by the
  attack upon Queenstown. General Van Rensselaer, in a letter to
  Major-General Dearborn, written five days previously, says thus:
  'Should we succeed, we shall <a name="Page_353" id=
  "Page_353"></a>effect a great discomfiture of the enemy, by
  breaking their line of communication, driving their shipping from
  the mouth of this river, leaving them no rallying point in this
  part of the country, appalling the minds of the Canadians, and
  opening a wide and safe communication for our supplies; we shall
  save our own land,&mdash;wipe away part of the score of our past
  disgrace,&mdash;get excellent barracks and winter quarters, and
  at least be prepared for an early campaign another year.'</p>

  <p>"It is often said, that we throw away by the pen what we gain
  by the sword. Had General Brock been less prodigal of his
  valuable life, and survived the Queenstown battle, he would have
  made the 13th of October a still more 'memorable' day, by
  crossing the river and carrying Fort Niagara, which, at that
  precise time, was nearly stripped of its garrison. Instead of
  doing this, and thus putting an end to the campaign upon the
  Niagara frontier, Major-General Sheaffe, General Brock's
  successor, allowed himself to be persuaded to sign an
  armistice."</p>

  <p>In November, the Americans were already in command of Lake
  Ontario,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id=
  "FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class=
  "fnanchor">[120]</a> and their fleet, after chasing the Royal
  George into Kingston, captured on the 12th the transport sloop
  Elizabeth, on board <a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>of which
  was Mr. Brock, paymaster of the 49th. He was paroled by Commodore
  Chauncey, who, to his credit be it said, immediately restored
  "the plate and effects belonging to his late illustrious
  relative," which he was conveying from Fort George to Kingston.
  The box of letters and other papers from which this little work
  has been principally compiled, was, we believe, among these
  effects; and we gladly seize this opportunity to express the
  obligation of Sir Isaac Brock's family to the commodore for his
  generosity on this occasion.</p>

  <p>On the 27th April, 1813, York was captured by Major-General
  Dearborn, with 1,800 American troops, embarked in fourteen sail
  of armed vessels, that post being occupied by 700 regulars and
  militia, with from 40 to 50 Indians, the whole under the
  immediate command of Sir Roger Sheaffe. In resisting the enemy,
  the grenadier company of the 8th (the king's) regiment greatly
  distinguished themselves, losing their captain, M'Neal, and being
  nearly annihilated. By an explosion of the powder magazine, to
  which a train had been laid, 260 of the Americans were killed or
  wounded, including Brigadier Pike among the former; and they were
  thrown into such confusion, that an immediate and resolute attack
  would probably have sent them back to their ships.<a name=
  "FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The British
  general "drew off his <a name="Page_355" id=
  "Page_355"></a>regulars and left the rest to capitulate within
  the town, wherein considerable public stores were lost;"<a name=
  "FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and the Americans,
  having secured their booty, re-embarked and sailed on the 2d of
  May for Niagara. The inhabitants of York do not appear to have
  been satisfied with the conduct of Major-General Sheaffe in this
  affair; and, although it was not ascertained whether his removal
  was the result of the displeasure of the Commander-in-chief, he
  was replaced early in July by Major-General de Rottenburg, and on
  his arrival in the Lower Province he assumed the command of the
  troops in the district of Montreal. A few months after, the Baron
  de Rottenburg was in his turn succeeded by Lieut.-General Gordon
  Drummond, who commanded in Upper Canada to the end of the
  war.</p>

  <p>We have alluded (page <a href='#Page_278'>278</a>) to the
  discomfiture of Sir George Prevost before Sackett's Harbour, that
  naval arsenal whose destruction Major-General Brock was so
  unfortunately prevented from undertaking. The governor-general
  having proceeded in May from Montreal to Kingston with Sir James
  Yeo, who had just arrived from England to command the British
  naval forces on the lakes&mdash;the squadron on Lake Ontario now
  consisting of two ships, a brig, and two schooners&mdash;the
  public was on the tiptoe of expectation for some decisive dash on
  the enemy's flotilla on that lake. An attack upon Sackett's
  Harbour, in the absence of their fleet at <a name="Page_356" id=
  "Page_356"></a>Niagara, was resolved upon, so as to destroy "the
  forts, the arsenals, and the dock-yard, where the Americans had a
  frigate almost ready for launching, and several other vessels;
  but when this wavering and spiritless general reconnoitred the
  place, he would not venture an attack, and returned across the
  water towards Kingston. Then he changed his mind and went back to
  Sackett's Harbour; and (but not without more wavering and loss of
  time) our troops, about 750 strong, were landed. The Americans
  were presently driven at the bayonet's point into some loop-holed
  barracks and forts; and so panic-stricken were they that they
  immediately set fire to their new frigate, their naval barracks
  and arsenal, and destroyed a gun-brig and all the stores which
  had so recently been captured at York. While the arsenal was in
  flames, while the Americans were flying through the village, and
  when the complete success of the assailants was certain, Sir
  George Prevost sent a precipitate order for retreat, merely
  because a momentary resistance was offered by a party of
  Americans who had taken refuge in the log-barracks! The British
  troops reluctantly obeyed their general's order and returned to
  their boats, men and officers being acutely sensible to his
  folly, and wondering by what means so incompetent a commander had
  been placed over them. If Sir George Prevost had studied the
  history of the war of the American revolution, it could only have
  been with an eye to copy all the indecisions <a name="Page_357"
  id="Page_357"></a>and blunders of the formalising, badly
  instructed English generals of that period. But the Howes,
  Clintons, and Burgoynes, were at least always ready to fight. As
  soon as the Americans could believe that the English were really
  abandoning their enterprize at the moment that it was all but
  completed, they rushed back to stop the conflagration: they were
  too late to save the stores which had been brought from York, the
  navy barracks, or the brig, but the frigate on the stocks, being
  built of green wood, would not easily burn, and was found but
  little injured. If the destruction at Sackett's Harbour had been
  completed, we should have deprived the Americans of every
  prospect of obtaining the ascendancy on the lake."<a name=
  "FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> And, as if to
  crown this miserable failure, the details were narrated by the
  adjutant-general, in a dispatch to Sir George Prevost, as if
  Colonel Baynes had commanded in chief, and the governor-general
  had been present as a mere spectator!<a name="FNanchor_124_124"
  id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class=
  "fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

  <p>From these humiliating occurrences on Lake Ontario, we turn to
  the captured post of Detroit, which, it will be remembered, was
  left by Major-General Brock in charge of Colonel Proctor. No
  sooner had intelligence of the surrender of <a name="Page_358"
  id="Page_358"></a>Hull reached Washington, than the renewal of
  the North-Western army for the recovery of the Michigan territory
  became the anxious object of the American government. That army,
  which eventually outnumbered the former one, was placed under the
  command of Major-General Harrison, (who died a few years since
  while president of the United States,) and in September was in
  full march for the Miami rapids, the spot assigned as the general
  rendezvous. In January, 1813, Colonel Proctor received
  information that a brigade of that army, under Brigadier
  Winchester, was encamped at Frenchtown, on the river Raisin, 40
  miles south of Detroit. The British commander, although he had
  orders not to act on the offensive, promptly determined to attack
  this brigade before it was reinforced by the main body, a few
  days march in the rear; and with his disposable force, consisting
  of 500 regulars, militia, and seamen, he made a resolute assault,
  at dawn on the 22d, on the enemy's camp, which was completely
  successful. In this affair the Americans lost between 3 and 400
  men killed; and Brigadier Winchester, 3 field officers, 9
  captains, 20 subalterns, and upwards of 500 men, in prisoners.
  This gallant exploit secured Detroit from any immediate danger,
  but the day after it was sadly tarnished by the straggling
  Indians, who massacred such wounded prisoners as were unable to
  walk, the guard left for their protection deserting their charge
  on a false alarm of General Harrison's <a name="Page_359" id=
  "Page_359"></a>approach. This success, for which Colonel Proctor
  was immediately promoted to the rank of Brigadier, together with
  the spoil obtained at Frenchtown, brought down several warlike
  tribes of Indians from the river Wabash, and even from the more
  distant Mississippi, to join the British standard. Towards the
  end of March, Proctor learnt that General Harrison intended to
  commence active operations for the recovery of the Michigan
  territory, on the arrival of considerable reinforcements which he
  was expecting. Resolved to try the issue of another attack before
  the enemy, already much superior in numbers, gained a fresh
  acquisition of strength, Proctor embarked at Amherstburg with 520
  regulars and 460 militia, and made for the mouth of the Miami,
  which falls into Lake Erie. He ascended that river, about 1,200
  Indians co-operating with him, and landed his troops, stores, and
  ordnance, on the 28th of April, near Fort Meigs, mounting
  eighteen guns, which he cannonaded from both banks of the Miami,
  On the 5th of May the enemy's long-expected reinforcements, under
  Major-General Clay, came suddenly down the river; they were 1,300
  strong, but newly-raised militia; and as the boats drew near,
  Harrison ordered Clay to storm the British batteries on the
  opposite or north side of the river, while a sortie was made from
  the fort for the purpose of capturing the three British guns on
  the southern bank. For a short period the British batteries on
  both sides were in the hands of the <a name="Page_360" id=
  "Page_360"></a>enemy, but they were quickly regained by bayonet
  charges; and on the north bank Colonel Dudley, after spiking the
  captured guns, having marched with 400 men to attack the British
  camp, was drawn into an ambuscade by the Indians, and himself and
  about half his men were slain. Of the Americans, about 550 men
  were made prisoners, and their killed and wounded were estimated
  at nearly as many more. The far-famed Tecumseh buried his
  tomahawk in the head of a Chippewa chief, whom he found actively
  engaged in massacring some of the prisoners. But as the Indians
  retired, as is their wont after success, to enjoy their plunder;
  and as many of the militia were also returning to their homes,
  Proctor was compelled to raise the siege of Fort Meigs. Having
  re-embarked his small force of regulars, chiefly of the 41st, and
  the whole of his ordnance and stores, he proceeded to Sandwich;
  while General Harrison abandoned all intention of advancing
  against Detroit until the American squadron had gained the
  command of Lake Erie.</p>

  <p>Major-General Proctor having determined to recommence his
  attacks against the American North-Western army, whose head
  quarters were then in the neighbourhood of Sandusky Bay, on Lake
  Erie, he landed on the 1st of August near the Sandusky river, and
  soon after invested with 400 regulars and between 3 and 400
  Indians, Fort Stephenson, about 20 miles from its mouth. On the
  2d, a fire was opened from two 6-pounders and <a name="Page_361"
  id="Page_361"></a>two 5&frac12;-inch howitzers against the fort,
  which appears to have possessed only one masked 6-pounder, and to
  have been garrisoned by about 180 men, under Major Croghan, but
  as the fire produced no impression, the place was ordered to be
  stormed. The assailants reached the ditch which was raked by the
  masked gun, and sustained in consequence so severe a loss, that
  they retreated precipitately, having their leader, Brevet
  Lieut-Colonel Short, of the 41st, with 3 officers and 52 men,
  killed or missing, besides 3 officers and 38 men wounded; while
  the Americans had only 1 killed and 7 slightly wounded. The
  Indians did not assist in the assault, withdrawing to a ravine
  out of gun shot. Thus foiled, Proctor retired on the 3d, and
  after abandoning "considerable baggage and a gun-boat laden with
  cannon ball," he returned to Amherstburg. The attack is said to
  have been "ill digested," and the expedition to have ended with
  "some disgrace."</p>

  <p>Towards the end of August, (1813,) the American squadron,
  under Commodore Perry, became too powerful for the British, under
  Captain Barclay, who now remained at Amherstburg to await the
  equipment of the Detroit, recently launched. The British forces
  in the neighbourhood falling short of various supplies, for which
  they depended chiefly upon the fleet, Captain Barclay had no
  other alternative than to risk a general engagement. With this
  purpose he sailed on the 9th of September, with his small
  squadron wretchedly <a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>manned,
  and the next day encountered the enemy. For some time the fate of
  the battle poised in favor of the British, as the principal
  American ship, the Lawrence, struck her colours; but a sudden
  breeze turned the scale against them, and the whole of their
  squadron was compelled to surrender, after a desperate engagement
  of upwards of three hours. Captain Barclay was dangerously
  wounded; Captain Finnis, of the Queen Charlotte, killed; and
  every commander and officer second in command was either killed
  or wounded.</p>

  <p>Major-General Proctor's army was deprived, by this disastrous
  defeat, of every prospect of obtaining its necessary supplies
  through Lake Erie, and a speedy retreat towards the head of Lake
  Ontario became inevitable. Stung with grief and indignation,
  Tecumseh at first refused to agree to the measure, and in a
  council of war held at Amherstburg on the 18th of September, he
  thus delivered his sentiments against it:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Father, listen to your children! You have them now all
    before you.</p>

    <p>The war before this, our British father gave the hatchet to
    his red children, when our old chiefs were alive. They are now
    dead. In that war our father was thrown on his back by the
    Americans, and our father took them by the hand without our
    knowledge; and we are afraid that our father will do so again
    at this time.</p>

    <p>The summer before last, when I came forward with my red
    brethren, and was ready to take up the hatchet in favor of our
    British father, we were told not to be in a hurry,&mdash;that
    he had not yet determined to fight the Americans.</p>

    <p><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>Listen! When war was
    declared, our father stood up and gave us the tomahawk, and
    told us that he was then ready to strike the Americans; that he
    wanted our assistance; and that he would certainly get us hack
    our lands, which the Americans had taken from us.</p>

    <p>Listen! You told us, at that time, to bring forward our
    families to this place, and we did so; and you promised to take
    care of them, and that they should want for nothing, while the
    men would go and fight the enemy; that we need not trouble
    ourselves about the enemy's garrisons; that we knew nothing
    about them, and that our father would attend to that part of
    the contest. You also told your red children that you would
    take good care of your garrison here, which made our hearts
    glad.</p>

    <p>Listen! When we were last at the Rapids, it is true we gave
    you little assistance. It is hard to fight people who live like
    ground hogs.</p>

    <p>Father, listen! Our fleet has gone out; we know they have
    fought; we have heard the great guns; but we know nothing of
    what has happened to our father with that arm. Our ships have
    gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our father
    tying up every thing and preparing to run away the other,
    without letting his red children know what his intentions are.
    You always told us to remain here and take care of our lands;
    it made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish. Our great
    father, the king, is the head, and you represent him. You
    always told us that you would never draw your foot off British
    ground; but now, father, we see you are drawing back, and we
    are sorry to observe our father doing so without seeing the
    enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a fat dog, that
    carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops
    it between its legs and runs off.</p>

    <p>Father, listen! The Americans have not yet defeated us by
    land; neither are we sure that they have done so by water:
    <i>we therefore wish to remain here and fight our</i> <a name=
    "Page_364" id="Page_364"></a><i>enemy, should they make their
    appearance</i>. If they defeat us, we will <i>then</i> retreat
    with our father.</p>

    <p>At the battle of the Rapids, last war, the Americans
    certainly defeated us; and, when we retreated to our father's
    fort in the neighbourhood, the gates were shut against us. We
    were afraid that it would again be the case; but, instead of
    closing the gates, we now see our British father preparing to
    march out of his garrison.</p>

    <p>Father! You have got the arms and ammunition which our great
    father sent for his red children. If you intend to retreat,
    give them to us, and you may go, and welcome for us. Our lives
    are in the hands of the Great Spirit. We are determined to
    defend our lands, and if it be His will, we wish to leave our
    bones upon them.</p>
  </div>

  <p>General Harrison's troops were soon transported by the
  American squadron to <i>Put-in-Bay</i>, and they occupied
  Amherstburg on the 23d of September, Proctor having previously
  fallen back upon Sandwich, after setting fire to the navy yard,
  barracks, and public stores at the former place. The British
  general, seeing the enemy determined to follow up his first
  success by an immediate attack upon Detroit, and being unable
  with his very inferior numbers to dispute the occupancy of that
  post, evacuated it and Sandwich on the 26th, also destroying the
  public property at both posts; and commenced his retreat along
  the river Thames, with between 900 and 1,000 regulars, chiefly of
  the 41st regiment. In this reverse of fortune, Tecumseh still
  adhered to the British standard with unswerving fidelity, and
  with the Indians covered the retreat. On the 2d of October,
  General Harrison marched in pursuit with <a name="Page_365" id=
  "Page_365"></a>rather above 3,000 men, escorted by three
  gun-boats and a number of bateaux. On the 4th, he came up with
  the rear guard, and not only made some prisoners, but succeeded
  in capturing a great part of the ammunition and stores. By this
  second reverse, the British were left destitute of the means of
  subsistence and protracted defence; and their commander being
  thus compelled to stake the fate of his small army on a general
  engagement, he took up an excellent position on the right bank of
  the Thames at the Moravian town, an Indian village 80 miles from
  Sandwich, his entire force now mustering barely 900 regulars and
  about 600 Indians. The former were posted in single files in two
  lines, their left resting on the river, their right on a narrow
  swamp, beyond which were the Indians, reaching obliquely
  backwards to a second and much broader swamp, so that neither
  flank of the allies could be easily turned. The enemy commenced
  the attack with a regiment of mounted riflemen, the
  <i>&eacute;lite</i> of their army, formed into two divisions of
  500 men each, one of which charged the regulars with great
  impetuosity, while the other advanced with a company of foot
  against the Indians. The regulars, dissatisfied by fancied or
  real neglect, and dispirited by long continued exposure and
  privation, made but a very feeble resistance; their ranks were
  pierced and broken, and being placed between two fires, they
  immediately surrendered, with the trifling loss of 12 killed and
  22 wounded, the British general and a <a name="Page_366" id=
  "Page_366"></a>part of the troops seeking safety in flight. But
  the Indians carried on the contest with the left of the American
  line with great determination, and did not retreat until the day
  was irretrievably lost and 33 of their numbers had been slain,
  including the noble Tecumseh&mdash;a warrior not less celebrated
  for his courage than for his humanity, his eloquence, and his
  influence over the different tribes. The Americans returned to
  Sandwich immediately after the action. Proctor is accused of
  leaving entire the bridges and roads in the rear of his
  retreating army, and of encumbering it with an unnecessary
  quantity of his own personal baggage; and certain it is that his
  defeat led to the harshest recrimination between Sir George
  Prevost and himself. The general order of the former on the
  subject was of unparalleled severity, as he said: "On this
  disgraceful day upwards of 600 officers and soldiers were taken
  prisoners almost without a struggle, of whom but very few
  appeared to have been rescued by an honorable death from the
  ignominy of passing under the American yoke; nor are there many
  whose wounds plead in mitigation of this reproach." The fugitives
  made the best of their way to Ancaster, at the head of Lake
  Ontario; and on the 17th of October they numbered there 240,
  including the general and 17 officers. The consequence of these
  disasters was the relinquishment, by the British, of the Michigan
  territory, with the exception of Michilimakinack; the abandonment
  of the posts in Upper Canada to the <a name="Page_367" id=
  "Page_367"></a>westward of the Grand River, or Ouse; and the loss
  of the services of the whole of the north-western Indians, with
  the exception of 2 or 300, who subsequently joined the centre
  division of the army.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id=
  "FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class=
  "fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

  <p>Fort George was taken in May, 1813, by a large American force,
  under General Dearborn, which compelled Major-General Vincent to
  withdraw his troops from Fort Erie and Chippewa, and to retreat
  to Burlington Heights, at the head of Lake Ontario, the British
  losing 52 killed, besides upwards of 300 wounded and missing.
  Immediately after the capture of Fort George, General Dearborn
  pushed forward a body of 3,000 infantry, with nine field pieces
  and 250 cavalry, for the purpose of dislodging Major-General
  Vincent from his position. Lieut.-Colonel Harvey,<a name=
  "FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> deputy
  adjutant-general, proposed a night attack on this body, which was
  approved, and with the 49th, under Major Plenderleath, and five
  companies of the 8th, under Major Ogilvie, (the whole only 704
  firelocks,) he led the attack in gallant style, and completely
  succeeded in surprising the enemy, who evinced a highly
  creditable state of order and discipline in repeatedly forming,
  though compelled as often to disperse <a name="Page_368" id=
  "Page_368"></a>before the resistless energy of the British
  bayonet. Two brigadiers, (Chandler and Winder,) 7 other officers
  and 116 men, with three guns and one brass howitzer, were taken
  in this intrepid attack, which, as it reduced the Americans from
  offensive to defensive operations, was of the greatest importance
  to the salvation of the Upper Province. The enemy, however,
  occupied Fort George till the month of December, when they were
  compelled to evacuate it and retreat across the Niagara.<a name=
  "FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> In that month,
  Colonel Murray surprised, and very gallantly captured by a night
  assault, Fort Niagara, which was retained by the British till the
  end of the war.</p>

  <p>The recovery of Michilimakinack had long been seriously
  contemplated by the American government, and would have been
  attempted in the fall of 1813, but for the lateness of the
  season, when the expulsion of the British from the banks of the
  Detroit had opened the passage into Lake Huron. On the other
  hand, the necessity of retaining a post so favorably situated, if
  in the hands of an enemy, for annoying the British north-western
  trade, pressed itself on Sir George Prevost; and in April, 1814,
  a reinforcement of about 90 men, under an active and zealous
  officer, Lieut.-Colonel M'Douall, was forwarded with military
  stores and provisions, by a back route to Michilimakinack. They
  embarked in twenty-four bateaux <a name="Page_369" id=
  "Page_369"></a>from Nottawassega Bay on Lake Huron, distant 260
  miles from Michilimakinack, and, after a very tempestuous passage
  of twenty-five days, reached the fort on the 18th of May. On the
  26th July, an American expedition from Lake Erie, consisting of
  three brigs and two schooners of war, under Captain Sinclair,
  with nearly 800 troops on board, appeared off Michilimakinack,
  and a landing was effected by them on the 4th of August. The
  British force on the island amounted to only 190 men, including
  regulars, militia, and Indians, with which Lieut.-Colonel
  M'Donall repulsed every effort of the Americans to approach the
  fort; so that they were glad, to re-embark the same evening in
  the utmost haste and confusion, leaving 17 dead on the ground,
  while the garrison had only one Indian killed. Captain Sinclair
  stated what does not appear to have been known to Lieutenant
  Hanks, when he surrendered the island in 1812 to Captain
  Roberts,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=
  "FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class=
  "fnanchor">[128]</a> "that Michilimakinack is by nature a perfect
  Gibraltar, being a high inaccessible rock on every side,<a name=
  "FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> except the west,
  from which to the heights you have nearly two miles to pass
  through a wood so thick, that <a name="Page_370" id=
  "Page_370"></a>our men were shot in every direction, and within a
  few yards of them, without being able to see the Indians who did
  it." Michilimakinack remained unmolested to the end of the war,
  when it was restored, by the treaty of peace, to its former
  possessors.</p>

  <p>It has already been mentioned, that among the prisoners taken
  at the battle of Queenstown, 23 were sent to England for trial as
  British born subjects and deserters, and that the American
  government had placed an equal number of British soldiers into
  close confinement as hostages. In consequence, Sir George
  Prevost, by a general order of the 27th October, 1813, made known
  that he had received the commands of the prince regent to put 46
  American officers and non-commissioned officers into close
  confinement as hostages for the 23 soldiers confined by the
  American government. He at the same time apprized that
  government, that if any of the British soldiers should suffer
  death by reason of the guilt and execution of the traitors taken
  in arms against their country, he was instructed to select out of
  the American hostages double the number of the British soldiers
  who might be so unwarrantably put to death, and to cause them to
  suffer death immediately. The governor-general also notified to
  the American government, that in the event of their carrying
  their murderous threat into execution, the commanders of the
  British forces, by sea and land, were instructed to prosecute the
  war with <a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>unmitigated
  severity against all the territory and inhabitants of the United
  States.</p>

  <p>On the 10th of December, Sir George Prevost received a
  communication from Major-General Wilkinson by a flag of truce,
  stating that the American government, adhering unalterably to
  their previously declared purpose, had placed 46 British officers
  into close confinement, there to remain until the same number of
  American officers and non-commissioned officers were released. In
  consequence, the governor-general ordered all the American
  officers, prisoners of war, without exception of rank, to be
  placed into close confinement as hostages, until the number of 46
  was completed over and above those already in confinement. In
  pursuance of this order, Generals Winder, Chandler, and
  Winchester, were confined in a private house at Quebec, with as
  little inconvenience as their security would admit.</p>

  <p>On the 15th April, 1814, after some negotiation, opened at the
  solicitation of the American government, a convention was entered
  into at Montreal, by which it was agreed to release the hostages
  and to make an exchange of prisoners, the American government
  relinquishing its pretensions to retaliate for the prisoners sent
  to England for legal trial as traitors to their country. This
  convention was ratified in July, at Champlain, near the lines;
  but, whether by previous agreement or tacit understanding, the
  traitors, we believe, escaped the just punishment of their
  crime.</p>

  <p><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>The remaining events of
  the war in Canada during the campaigns of 1812, 13 and 14, do not
  fall within the scope of this memoir. Some we might chronicle
  with pride, but a few we could not record without shame; and, on
  the whole, we cannot but think that the same withering influence,
  which bound the hands and repressed the energies of "him who
  undoubtedly was the best officer that headed our troops
  throughout the war,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id=
  "FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class=
  "fnanchor">[130]</a> was visible to the termination of the
  contest&mdash;a contest in which we are satisfied the result
  would have been very different, "if a man of military genius,
  courage, quickness, and decision, had held the supreme
  command."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id=
  "FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class=
  "fnanchor">[131]</a> Indeed, when we reflect upon the management
  of that eventful war, we are often forcibly reminded, in the
  fatal loss of Sir Isaac Brock, of the pathetic lament of the
  gallant highlander, who, contrasting the irresolution of his
  present general with the deeds of his former chief, the renowned
  Grahame,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id=
  "FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class=
  "fnanchor">[132]</a> Viscount Dundee, mournfully exclaimed:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! for one hour of
  Dundee!</span><br /></p>

  <p>During the progress of the war, the British government made
  several overtures for a reconciliation; and at length, when
  Napoleon's disasters commenced, and the Eastern States were
  threaten<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>ing to dissolve the
  union, Madison expressed a wish to treat with England, even at
  the end of 1813. The negotiations were commenced in earnest at
  Ghent, in August, 1814, at a time when Great Britain, being at
  peace with the remainder of the world, was in a condition to
  prosecute the contest with all her energies; but her people
  wished for repose after the long and arduous struggle in which
  they had been engaged; and a treaty of peace, signed at Ghent on
  the 24th of December, was ratified by the two governments, the
  plenipotentiaries on both sides waiving every question at issue
  before the war, and restoring every acquisition of territory
  during its progress. Thus the Americans had only the Canadian and
  defenceless side of the Detroit to give in exchange for their
  fortress of Niagara and their key possession of
  Michilimakinack.</p>

  <p>Early in 1815, Sir George Prevost was directed to return to
  England for the purpose of meeting accusations relative to his
  conduct at Plattsburg, which had been preferred by Commodore Sir
  James Yeo, who, after some delay, produced his charges in legal
  form; and to afford time for the arrival of the necessary
  witnesses from Canada, the general court martial was postponed to
  the 12th of January, 1816. In the mean time the health of the
  late governor-general, naturally of a delicate cast, became
  seriously affected, partly from anxiety of mind, and he died in
  London on the 5th of January, exactly a week preceding the
  <a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>day appointed for his trial.
  Previously to his departure from Lower Canada, the commons, or
  French party, voted him the sum of &pound;5,000 for the purchase
  of a service of plate, as a tribute of respect, which vote was
  approved of by the prince regent; but the legislative council, or
  English party, refused their assent to a bill for that
  purpose.</p>

  <p>Sir George Prevost was of slight, diminutive person, and
  unsoldierlike appearance; his manners are represented as
  unassuming and social, and his temper as placid and forgiving.
  His public speeches or addresses are said to have partaken of
  even classical elegance, and his dispatches and general orders
  also afford proofs of his literary acquirements. Discredit can
  only be thrown on his character as a general; and indeed his best
  friends must admit that his defensive policy at the commencement
  of the war, and his subsequent irresolution and infirmity of
  purpose, did not tend to raise the glory of England, or to
  advance his own fame, and that of every enterprizing officer who
  served under him. And yet soon after his death, notwithstanding
  that the lamentable failures at Sackett's Harbour and Plattsburg
  were fresh in the public recollection, new and honorary armorial
  bearings, with supporters, were solicited and obtained by his
  family in seeming approbation of his services in Canada, the
  supporters being two grenadiers of the 16th foot, of which
  regiment Sir George was colonel, each bearing a flag, gules; the
  dexter flag inscribed, "West Indies"&mdash;the <a name="Page_375"
  id="Page_375"></a>sinister, "Canada"! If these distinctions were
  conferred in honor of his civil administration, which we have
  already eulogized, although <i>Veritas</i>, in his well-known
  letters, stoutly denied him any merit even on this point, they
  were, we believe, justly bestowed; but if they were intended as
  an approval of his military conduct during the contest, certain
  it is that his contemporaries indignantly refused to concede his
  claim to them, and that no historian has as yet admitted that
  claim.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id=
  "FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class=
  "fnanchor">[133]</a> It was unfortunate for Sir George that he
  was called upon to wage war against the United States, as his
  natural and excusable sympathies in favor of a people among whom
  he had been born, and <a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a>at
  least partly educated, may have influenced his judgment without
  any conscious betrayal of the great charge entrusted to him; and
  this remark applies with double force to his school-fellow, Sir
  Roger Sheaffe, whose entire family and connexions were American.
  In any case, it was hard on Sir Isaac Brock, after being retained
  in Canada by Sir James Craig, when he was so anxious to serve in
  the Peninsula, because that officer could not spare him, and
  after at length obtaining leave to return to Europe for that
  purpose&mdash;it was hard, we repeat, when hostilities did at
  last break out in America, that his energies should have been so
  cramped by the passive attitude of his superior. Remembering,
  however, the maxim, <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>, the editor
  has refrained from transcribing aught reflecting on the memory of
  that superior when he could do so consistently with truth,
  although he feels acutely that the death of Sir Isaac
  Brock&mdash;hastened as he believes it was by the defensive
  policy and mistaken views of Sir George Prevost&mdash;was an
  irreparable loss to his many brothers,<a name="FNanchor_134_134"
  id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class=
  "fnanchor">[134]</a> who were at that period just rising into
  manhood, and in consequence required all the interest for their
  advancement which their uncle would probably have possessed. One
  especially, who closely resembled him both in appear<a name=
  "Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>ance and character, and who would
  have been an ornament to any service, was compelled to embrace
  the profession of arms, for which he had been educated, under the
  banners of a foreign and far distant country. In that country,
  Chile, Colonel Tupper cruelly fell at the early age of
  twenty-nine years; and if the reader will turn to the memoir of
  this daring soldier in the Appendix, necessarily brief as it is,
  he will probably agree with the British consul who wrote, that he
  had "for many years looked upon his gallant and honorable conduct
  as reflecting lustre upon the English name;" and he will think
  with the French traveller, who, after highly eulogizing him,
  said: "N'est-il pas d&eacute;plorable que de tels hommes en
  soient r&eacute;duits &agrave; se consacrer &agrave; une cause
  &eacute;trang&egrave;re?"</p>

  <p>As Tecumseh was so conspicuous in the annals of this war for
  his fidelity and devotion to the British crown, and as his name
  has occurred so often in these pages,<a name="FNanchor_135_135"
  id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class=
  "fnanchor">[135]</a> a concluding and connected notice of him
  will surely be deemed but an act of justice to his memory.</p>

  <p>This renowned aboriginal chief was a Shawanee, and was born in
  1769 or 1770, about the same year as his "brave brother warrior,"
  Sir Isaac Brock. He may be said to have been inured to war from
  his infancy, as the Indian nations continued in hostility against
  the United States after their inde<a name="Page_378" id=
  "Page_378"></a>pendence was achieved, alleging that they
  infringed on their territories. In 1790, about which period
  Tecumseh first gave proofs of that talent and daring which so
  distinguished his after-life, General Harmer was dispatched with
  a competent force to punish the predatory incursions of the
  Indians; but he was glad to return, with the loss of many of his
  men. In the following year, General St. Clair proceeded with
  another army to ravage the Miami and Shawanee settlements, and
  was even more unfortunate than his predecessor, as the Indians
  boldly advanced to meet him on the way, attacked his encampment,
  and put his troops to a total rout, in which the greater part
  were cut off and destroyed. In 1794, however, a much more
  formidable expedition, under General Wayne, entered the Indian
  territory; the warriors gradually retired as the Americans
  advanced, but at length imprudently determined on making a stand.
  In the battle which ensued, the Indians were so completely
  discomfited, that, the following year, they agreed to the treaty
  of Greenville, by which they were compelled to cede a large tract
  of country as an indemnity for <i>past injuries</i>! As Tecumseh
  had then scarcely completed his twenty-fifth year, and as the
  Indians pay great deference to age, it is not probable that he
  had any hand in this treaty, the more especially as, from that
  period to 1812, he laboured incessantly to unite the numerous
  aboriginal tribes of the North American continent in one grand
  confederacy, for the three<a name="Page_379" id=
  "Page_379"></a>fold purpose of endeavouring to regain their
  former possessions as far as the Ohio, of resisting the further
  encroachments of the whites, and of preventing the future cession
  of land by any one tribe, without the sanction of all, obtained
  in a general council. With this object he visited the different
  nations; and having assembled the elders, he enforced his
  disinterested views in strains of such impassioned and persuasive
  eloquence, that the greater part promised him their co-operation
  and assistance. But, to form a general alliance of so many and
  such various tribes, required a higher degree of patriotism and
  civilization than the Indians had attained. From the numbers,
  however, who ranged themselves with Tecumseh under the British
  standard; on the breaking out of the war in 1812, it is evident
  that he had acquired no little influence over them, and that his
  almost incredible exertions, both of mind and body, had not been
  altogether thrown away.</p>

  <p>About the year 1804, the brother of Tecumseh proclaimed
  himself a prophet, who had been commanded by the Great Spirit,
  the Creator of the red, but not of the white, people, to announce
  to his children, that the misfortunes by which they had been
  assailed arose from their having abandoned the mode of life which
  He had prescribed to them. He declared that they must return to
  their primitive habits&mdash;relinquish the use of ardent
  spirits&mdash;and clothe themselves in skins, and not in
  woollens. His fame soon spread among the <a name="Page_380" id=
  "Page_380"></a>surrounding nations, and his power to perform
  miracles was generally believed. He was joined by many, and not a
  few came from a great distance, and cheerfully submitted to much
  hardship and fatigue, that they might behold the prophet, and
  then return. He first established himself at Greenville, within
  the boundary of the United States; but the inhabitants of Ohio
  becoming alarmed at the immense assemblage of Indians on their
  frontier, the American authorities insisted on his removal.
  Accordingly, he proceeded, in 1808, to the Wabash, and fixed his
  residence on the northern bank of that river, near the mouth of
  the Tippecanoe. Here his popularity declined, but, through the
  influence of Tecumseh, he was again joined by many among the
  neighbouring tribes. The prophet's temporal concerns were
  conducted by Tecumseh, who adroitly availed himself of his
  brother's spiritual power to promote his favourite scheme of a
  general confederacy.</p>

  <p>In 1811, Tecumseh, accompanied by several hundred warriors,
  encamped near Vincennes, the capital of Indiana, and demanded an
  interview with the governor of that state, Major-General
  Harrison, the same officer who, in 1813, commanded the victorious
  troops at the battle of the Thames, in which Tecumseh lost his
  life. The interview was agreed to, and the governor inquired
  whether the Indians intended to come armed to the council.
  Tecumseh replied that he would be governed by the conduct of the
  white people; if <a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>they came
  armed, his warriors would be armed also; if not, his followers
  would come unarmed. The governor informed him that he would be
  attended by a troop of dragoons, dismounted, with their side arms
  only, and that the Indians might bring their war clubs and
  tomahawks. The meeting took place in a large arbour, on one side
  of which were the dragoons, eighty in number, seated in rows; on
  the other the Indians. But besides their sabres, the dragoons
  were armed with pistols. The following incident is said to have
  occurred at this interview. Tecumseh looked round for a seat, but
  not finding one provided for him, he betrayed his surprise, and
  his eyes flashed fire. The governor, perceiving the cause,
  instantly ordered a chair. One of the council offered the warrior
  his chair, and, bowing respectfully, said to him: "Warrior, your
  father, General Harrison, offers you a seat." "My father!"
  exclaimed Tecumseh, extending his hand towards the heavens, "the
  sun is my father, and the earth is my mother; she gives me
  nourishment, and I will repose on her bosom." He then threw
  himself on the ground. When the governor, who was seated in front
  of the dragoons, commenced his address, Tecumseh declared that he
  could not hear him, and requested him to remove his seat to an
  open space near himself, The governor complied, and in his speech
  complained of the constant depredations and murders which were
  committed by the Indians of Tippecanoe; of the refusal on their
  part to give up <a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>the
  criminals; and of the increasing accumulation of force in that
  quarter, for the avowed purpose of compelling the United States
  to relinquish lands, which they had fairly purchased of the
  rightful owners. Tecumseh, in his answer, denied that he had
  afforded protection to the guilty, but manfully admitted his
  design of forming a confederacy of all the red nations of that
  continent. He observed, that "the system, which the United States
  pursued of purchasing lands from the Indians, he viewed as a
  <i>mighty water</i>, ready to overflow his people, and that the
  confederacy which he was forming among the tribes, to prevent any
  tribe from selling land without the consent of the others, was
  the <i>dam</i> he was erecting, to resist this mighty water." And
  he added, "your great father, the president, may sit over the
  mountains and drink his wine, but if he continue this policy, you
  and I will have to meet on the battle field." He also admitted,
  that he was then on his way to the Creek nation, for the purpose
  he had just avowed, and he continued his journey two days after,
  with twelve or fifteen of his warriors. Having visited the Creek
  and other southern tribes, he crossed the Mississippi, and
  continued a northern course as far as the river Demoins, whence
  he returned to the Wabash by land. But a sad reverse of fortune
  awaited his return; he found his town consumed, his bravest
  warriors slain, and a large deposit of provisions destroyed. On
  his departure, the settlement at Tippecanoe was left in <a name=
  "Page_383" id="Page_383"></a>charge of his brother, the prophet,
  with strict injunctions to prevent all hostile incursions, as
  they might lead to extremities before his plans were matured. The
  prophet, however, wanted either the inclination or the authority
  to follow these injunctions; and the Americans assert, that
  murder and rapine occurred now so frequently, that they were
  compelled, in their own defence, to punish the delinquents.
  Accordingly, General Harrison proceeded with nearly 1,000 men to
  Tippecanoe, and on his approach, in November, 1811, was met by
  about 600 warriors; a battle ensued, in which the Indians,
  deprived by the absence of their chief of his counsel and
  example, were defeated, but with nearly equal loss on both sides.
  Assured by the prophet that the American bullets would not injure
  them, they rushed on the bayonets with their war clubs, and
  exposed their persons with a fatal fearlessness. But the prophet
  himself remained during the battle in security on an adjacent
  eminence; he was chaunting a war song, when information was
  brought to him that his men were falling. "Let them fight on, for
  my prediction will soon be verified," was the substance of his
  reply, and he resumed his song in a louder key!</p>

  <p>The hostility of Tecumseh to those whom he had ever considered
  as the spoilers of his country, was, if possible, redoubled by
  this severe act of retaliation. General Harrison, in particular,
  incurred his personal enmity, and he declared openly <a name=
  "Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>that he would seek for vengeance.
  Nor was he backward in putting his threats into execution. Early
  in 1812, the Indians renewed their hostile incursions, but they
  were now treated with unusual forbearance, in the hope that they
  would remain neutral in the war with Great Britain, which the
  American government well knew was near at hand. On its
  declaration in June, however, Tecumseh eagerly embraced the
  opportunity which it afforded, not only to promote his long
  meditated public views, but to avenge his private injuries; and,
  hastening with his warriors to Upper Canada, he had soon the
  gratification of witnessing, at Detroit, the surrender of the 4th
  U.S. infantry, (or heroes of Tippecanoe, as they were then
  denominated,) which regiment claimed the principal merit of
  having, the preceding year, defeated his followers and destroyed
  his settlement.</p>

  <p>Previously to the battle of the Thames, already noticed, the
  position chosen to await the attack of the American army, and the
  disposition of the British force, were approved of by Tecumseh,
  and his last words to General Proctor were: "Father, tell your
  young men to be firm, and all will be well." He then repaired to
  his people, and harangued them before they occupied their post.
  While the white troops were so quickly overcome, Tecumseh and his
  warriors almost as rapidly repelled the enemy; and the Indians
  continued to push their advantage in ignorance of the disaster of
  their allies, until their heroic chief fell by a rifle <a name=
  "Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>bullet, while in the act of
  advancing to close with Colonel Johnson, who was on horseback
  commanding his regiment of mounted riflemen.</p>

  <p>Of the many Indian chiefs who distinguished themselves in the
  wars of the whites, Tecumseh was undoubtedly the greatest since
  the days of Pontiac. Sir Isaac Brock has expressed his warm
  admiration of him, and it is well known that the feeling was
  mutual; but it is said that after the death of his friend and
  patron, Tecumseh found no kindred spirit with whom to act. In
  early life he was addicted to inebriety, the prevailing vice of
  the Indians, but his good sense and resolution conquered the
  habit, and, in his later years, he was remarkable for temperance.
  Glory became his ruling passion, and in its acquisition he was
  careless of wealth, as, although his presents and booty must have
  been of considerable value, he preserved little or nothing for
  himself. In height he was five feet ten inches, well formed, and
  capable of enduring fatigue in an extraordinary degree. His
  carriage was erect and commanding, and there was an air of
  hauteur in his countenance, arising from an elevated pride of
  soul, which did not forsake it when life was extinct. He was
  habitually taciturn, but, when excited, his eloquence was
  nervous, concise, and figurative. His dress was plain, and he was
  never known to indulge in the gaudy decoration of his person,
  which is the common practice of the Indians. On the day of his
  death, he wore a dressed deer skin coat <a name="Page_386" id=
  "Page_386"></a>and pantaloons. He was present in almost every
  action against the Americans, from the period of Harmer's defeat
  to the battle of the Thames&mdash;was several times
  wounded&mdash;and always sought the hottest of the fire. On the
  19th July, 1812, he pursued, near Sandwich, a detachment of the
  American army under Colonel M'Arthur, and fired on the rear
  guard. The colonel suddenly faced about his men and gave orders
  for a volley, when all the Indians fell flat on the ground with
  the exception of Tecumseh, who stood firm on his feet, with
  apparent unconcern! After his fall, his lifeless corpse was
  viewed with great interest by the American officers, who declared
  that the contour of his features was majestic even in death. And
  notwithstanding, it is said by an American writer, that "some of
  the Kentuckians disgraced themselves by committing indignities on
  his dead body. He was scalped, and <i>otherwise disfigured</i>."
  He left a son, who fought by his side when he fell, and was then
  about seventeen years old. The prince regent, in 1814, as a mark
  of respect to the memory of the father, sent a handsome sword as
  a present to the son. A nephew of Tecumseh and of the prophet,
  (their sister's son,) who was highly valued by the Americans, was
  slain in their service, in November, 1812, on the northern bank
  of the river Miami. Having been brought up by the American
  general, Logan, he had adopted that officer's name. He asserted
  that Tecumseh had in vain sought to engage him in the war on the
  side of the British.</p>

    in the name and on the behalf of his majesty, that the officers
    present at the capture of Detroit should be permitted to bear a
    medal commemorative of that brilliant victory, I have to
    transmit to you the medal<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id=
    "FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class=
    "fnanchor">[136]</a> which would have been conferred upon the
    late Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, and which the prince regent
    has been <a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>pleased to direct
    should be deposited with his family, as a token of the respect
    which his royal highness entertains for the memory of that
    officer.</p>

  <p>In the year 1817, Mr. Savery Brock visited the United States
  and Canada, and, while in the latter country, received the grants
  of the 12,000 acres of land voted by the legislature of the Upper
  Province to the four brothers of Sir Isaac Brock, The letters
  written by him during his travels were highly prized at the time,
  and the following are brief extracts from them:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>YORK, Upper Canada, Aug. 20 to 25, 1817.</p>

    <p>I travelled with three gentlemen from New York as far as
    Fort George, where they left me on their return by Montreal. We
    crossed at Buffalo on the 9th instant, at which place we
    arrived half an hour before the President; and although one of
    our party (Mr. Gouverneur) was his nephew, we did not delay our
    journey to have a view of his countenance, and came over to
    Fort Erie, or, properly speaking, its remains. Seven miles from
    the Fort, we stopped the next morning to breakfast at a house
    where Isaac had lived six months, and the landlord told me with
    tears: "He was a friend and a father to me. I was close to him
    when he was shot;"&mdash;with these words, unable from his
    feelings to add more, he walked away quickly up his orchard....
    On paying my respects to Mrs. <a name="Page_389" id=
    "Page_389"></a>Powell, the lady of the present chief justice,
    and to Mrs. Claus, they were greatly affected, and shed tears;
    and Mr. Scott, on whom I called yesterday, was equally so.
    Every one here is most kind&mdash;Isaac truly lived in their
    hearts: from one end of Canada to the other, he is beloved to a
    degree you can scarcely imagine&mdash;his memory will long live
    among them. "To your brother, Sir, we are indebted for the
    preservation of this province," is a sentiment that comes from
    the heart, and is in the mouths of too many to be flattery.
    This is pleasing, no doubt, to me, but it is a mournful
    pleasure, and recalls to me the past. I dine at five with the
    gentlemen of this town, and I see a splendid table laid out up
    stairs&mdash;the garrison is invited. I found no way to avoid
    these marks of respect to Isaac's memory. I assure you that it
    is truly unpleasant to me to see so many persons putting
    themselves in some degree out of their way to gratify me, as I
    think it, though I am aware they do it to satisfy their own
    feelings. I should also mention, that last Saturday I dined at
    Fort George, by invitation of the gentlemen there and its
    environs; we were <i>forty-nine</i> in number, and it was the
    anniversary of the capture of Detroit. I was invited, without
    their remembering the day of the month&mdash;it was a curious
    coincidence. The clergyman, who was of the party, made allusion
    during divine service next morning to Isaac, and to my being in
    the church. I mention these particulars, that you may fully
    judge of <a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>the kindness of
    all. After the service, three fine young farmers came up to me
    and wished to shake hands, having been at Detroit and
    Queenstown. Nothing could exceed their marks of attachment.
    Every body, they said, connected with Isaac would always be
    seen with pleasure: they were, like myself, most sensibly
    affected.</p>

    <p>I hear of such misconduct on the part of most of the
    generals, of such negligence that was occasioned by it on the
    part of other officers, that it is only surprising we retained
    the country. Every general required so much urging to permit an
    attack, that it was really a favor for any enterprising
    officer, who grieved that nothing was done, to be allowed a
    handful of men to defeat the enemy with. Poor York! how
    miserably defended; but I shall not enter into particulars, as
    no interest is now entertained for these affairs.</p>

    <p>MONTREAL, October 24.</p>

    <p>I have had 7,000 acres granted in East and West Flamborough,
    at the head of Lake Ontario, about twelve miles from its
    margin; this is the best of our land, but not a house within
    eight or nine miles of it; 1,200 acres in Brock township, on
    Lake Simcoe; 3,000 acres in Monaghan, on the Rice Lake; and 800
    acres in Murray, on Lake Ontario.</p>

    <p>The principal gentlemen of this place have formed a
    committee of eight persons, and waited on me to fix a day to
    dine with them. Tuesday is <a name="Page_391" id=
    "Page_391"></a>named. So very civil is every one, that I am
    quite overcome with their politeness. Colonel M'Bean, of the
    99th, and all his officers, have also called. Isaac's memory is
    so cherished&mdash;all loved him sincerely. At Quebec, I dined
    with Sir John Sherbrooke, &amp;c, visited the falls of
    Montmorenci, &amp;c, and was much pleased with my trip
    there.</p>

  <p><i>Extract from the Montreal Herald of November</i> 1,
  1817.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>On Tuesday, the 28th ultimo, the principal inhabitants of
    Montreal gave a public dinner at the Mansion House, to John
    Savery Brock, Esq., of the island of Guernsey, as a tribute of
    respect justly due to the memory of his late brother, the
    deceased Major-General Sir Isaac Brock.</p>

    <p>Sir John Johnson, Bart., took the chair at six o'clock,
    supported by Messrs. Forsyth and St. Dizier, vice-presidents,
    who conducted the arrangements of the table in a manner worthy
    of the occasion which the company had assembled to
    commemorate.</p>

    <p>After the cloth was removed, a series of appropriate toasts
    were given from the chair. When "the memory of the late
    Major-General Sir Isaac Brock" was pledged and drunk, Mr. B.
    availed himself of the universal silence it created to address
    the company. In a short speech, he expressed his
    acknowledgments for the very flattering and distinguished
    manner they were pleased, through him, to testify their
    veneration for the memory of his deceased brother, whose public
    and private qualities, he was proud to observe, were so highly
    appreciated by the inhabitants of Montreal, in whose society he
    had for a period been domesticated, and of whose kindness and
    hospitality he always retained a grateful remembrance.</p>

    <p>At the commencement of the American war, Mr. B. observed, an
    arduous command devolved upon his brother; he had to protect an
    extensive frontier with very limited means, and those means,
    feeble as they were, <a name="Page_392" id=
    "Page_392"></a>shackled by the trammels of superior authority;
    the advance of an hostile army, however, upon our provincial
    territory, developed the resources of his military genius, and
    afforded him a glorious opportunity of proving to his country
    what he <i>might</i> have achieved under different
    circumstances. Mr. Brock apologized to the company for
    detaining them a few minutes longer, in reading some extracts
    of letters he had received from the late general, at different
    times, previous to the battle of Queenstown. These extracts
    corroborated what Mr. B. had previously stated; and it is
    remarkable that in one of them, with a spirit almost prophetic,
    the hero foretold the issue of that eventful day, when the hand
    of victory was destined to mingle the cypress and the laurel
    over his grave. Mr. Brock's feelings were a good deal affected
    in addressing so numerous an assemblage of his late brother's
    personal friends; and we may venture to add, that never were
    feelings of the same description more sacredly participated
    than those of Mr. B. on this occasion. Mr. B. concluded his
    speech by drinking the health of the company, and "success and
    prosperity to the city of Montreal."</p>

    <p>At eleven o'clock the president retired, and was succeeded
    in the chair by the Hon. W. M'Gillivray, who immediately
    proposed the health of the worthy baronet, with three times
    three.</p>

    <p>The band of the 99th regiment attended and played a variety
    of beautiful airs, which, in addition to a number of excellent
    songs given in the coarse of the evening, seduced the party to
    remain until the "little hours" stole upon them.</p>

    <p>We regret that want of room prevents us from noticing as we
    could wish the neat and soldierlike address of thanks from
    Lieut.-Colonel M'Bean, on behalf of the garrison of Montreal,
    or of recording a translation of the figurative speeches,
    delivered in the Indian language by Lieut.-Colonel
    M'Kay<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id=

    the co-operation of the gallant warrior, Tecumseh, with the
    lamented chief whose immortal memory forms the subject of this

    <p>LONDON, April 12, 1825.</p>

    <p>I went to Windsor on Wednesday last with the four Indians,
    accompanied by my friend Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, to show them the
    castle, Frogmore, &amp;c.; but the chief object, which I had
    secretly in mind, was to have them introduced to his majesty.
    Sir John C&mdash;&mdash;, the late mayor of Windsor, assisted
    me very effectually, and the upshot of the matter is, that the
    king expressed his desire to see the Indian chiefs, although
    every body treated this as a most chimerical idea. They wore,
    for the first time, the brilliant clothes which Mr. Butterworth
    had had made for them, and you cannot conceive how grand and
    imposing they appeared.</p>

    <p>The king appointed half-past one on Thursday to receive our
    party at the royal lodge, his place of residence. We were
    ushered into the library; and now I am going to say somewhat
    pleasing to your uncle Savery. As Sir John C&mdash;&mdash; was
    in the act of introducing me, but before he had mentioned my
    name, Sir Andrew Barnard<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id=
    "FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class=
    "fnanchor">[139]</a> interrupted him, and said: "There is no
    occasion to introduce me to that gentleman,&mdash;I know him to
    be General Brock's brother,&mdash;he and Colonel Brock,
    <a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>of the 81st, were my most
    intimate friends,&mdash;I was in the 81st with the colonel.
    There was another brother whom I knew,&mdash;he who was
    paymaster of the 49th,&mdash;he was a gallant fellow. By the
    bye, sir, I beg your pardon; perhaps I am speaking to that very
    gentleman."</p>

    <p>In the library there was also present Marquess Conyngham,
    Lord Mount Charles, Sir Edmund Nagle, &amp;c. &amp;c. We
    remained chatting in the house above half an hour, expecting
    every moment to see the king enter; and I was greatly amused to
    observe Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; and Sir John C&mdash;&mdash; start
    and appear convulsed every time there was a noise outside the
    door. We were admiring the fine lawn when the Marquess
    Conyngham asked the Indians if they would like to take a turn,
    at the same time opening the beautiful door that leads to it.
    The party was no sooner out than we saw the king standing quite
    still, and as erect as a grenadier on a field day, some forty
    yards from us. We were all immediately uncovered, and advanced
    slowly towards the handsomest, the most elegant, the most
    enchanting man in the kingdom; the Indians conducted by
    Marquess Conyngham, Sir Edmund Nagle, Sir Andrew Barnard, Lord
    Mount Charles, &amp;c. &amp;c. The range of balconies was
    filled with ladies. Sir John C&mdash;&mdash;, Mr.
    W&mdash;&mdash; and I, allowed the party to approach his
    majesty, while we modestly halted at a distance of twenty
    yards. It was worth while being there only to see the benign
    counte<a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a>nance of the
    greatest monarch in the world, and to witness his manner of
    uncovering his head. The four chiefs fell on their knees. The
    king desired them to rise, and entered into a great deal of
    preliminary conversation. I saw him turn towards the marquess,
    and after a few seconds he said, with his loud and sonorous
    voice: "Pray, Mr. Brock, come near me,&mdash;I pray you come
    near me." I felt a little for my companions who continued
    unnoticed, and especially for Sir John C&mdash;&mdash;, to whom
    I was principally indebted for the royal interview.</p>

    <p>The king addressed the Indians in French, very distinctly,
    fluently, and loud: "I observe you have the portrait of my
    father; will you permit me to present you with mine?" The
    marquess then produced four large and weighty gold coronation
    peer medallions of his majesty, suspended by a rich mazareen
    blue silk riband. The chiefs, seeing this, dropped again upon
    their knees, and the king took the four medallions successively
    into his hand, and said: "Will some gentleman have the goodness
    to tie this behind?"&mdash;upon which Sir Edmund Nagle, with
    whom we had been condoling on account of the gout, while
    waiting in the library, and who wore a list shoe, skipped
    nimbly behind the chiefs, and received the string from the
    king, tying the cordon on the necks of the four chiefs. We were
    much amused to observe how the royal word can dispel the gout.
    The instant the grand chief was within reach of <a name=
    "Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>the medallion, and before the
    investiture was completed, he seized the welcome present with
    the utmost earnestness, and kissed it with an ardour which must
    have been witnessed to be conceived. The king appeared sensibly
    affected by this strong and unequivocal mark of grateful
    emotion. The other chiefs acted in a similar way, and nothing
    could have been managed more naturally, or in better taste.
    After this ceremony, the king desired them to rise and to be
    covered. They put on their hats, and which appeared
    extraordinary to me, his majesty remained uncovered all the
    time. Here it was that the grand chief, as if incapable of
    repressing his feelings, poured out in a most eloquent manner,
    by voice and action, the following unpremeditated speech in his
    native Indian tongue. I say unpremeditated, because that fine
    allusion to the sun could not have been contemplated while we
    were waiting in the library, the room where we expected the
    interview to take place. I was pleased to find that the
    presence of this mighty sovereign, who governs the most
    powerful nation upon earth, did not drive from the thoughts of
    the pious chief, the King of kings and the Lord of lords.</p>

    <p>The instant he had finished, the chief of the warriors
    interpreted in the French language, and I wrote down the speech
    as soon as I left the royal lodge. It should be observed, that
    the chiefs had been previously informed by me that, according
    to etiquette, they should answer any questions which <a name=
    "Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>his majesty might be pleased to
    ask, but not introduce any conversation of their own. The sun
    was shining vividly.</p>

    <p>THE SPEECH.</p>

    <p>I was instructed not to speak in the royal presence, unless
    in answer to your majesty's questions. But my feelings
    overpower me. My heart is full. I am amazed at such unexpected
    grace and condescension, and cannot doubt that I shall be
    pardoned for expressing my gratitude. The sun is shedding his
    genial rays upon our heads. He reminds us of the great Creator
    of the universe&mdash;of Him who can make alive and who can
    kill. Oh! may that gracious and beneficent Being, who promises
    to answer the fervent prayers of his people, bless abundantly
    your majesty. May He grant you much bodily health, and, for the
    sake of your happy subjects, may He prolong your valuable life!
    It is not alone the four individuals, who now stand before your
    majesty, who will retain to the end of their lives a sense of
    this kind and touching reception&mdash;the whole of the
    nations, whose representatives we are, will ever love and be
    devoted to you, their good and great father.</p>
  </div>

  <p>His majesty felt deeply every word of the speech, when
  interpreted by the chief of the warriors. The king answered, that
  he derived high satisfaction from the sentiments they had
  expressed, and assured them that he should always be much
  interested in the happiness of his North American subjects, and
  would avail himself of every opportunity to promote their
  welfare, and to prove that he was indeed their father. After
  acknowledging in gracious terms the pleasure which the speech of
  the grand chief had afforded him, <a name="Page_398" id=
  "Page_398"></a>he mentioned, in an easy and affable manner, that
  he had once before in his life seen some individuals of the
  Indian nations, but that was fifty-five or fifty-six years ago.
  He inquired of their passage to this country, the name of the
  ship and of the master, and was persevering in his questions as
  to the treatment they had experienced at his hands, whether they
  had been made comfortable in all respects, and if he had been
  polite and attentive.</p>

  <p>While the grand chief was delivering his speech in the Huron
  language, it seemed as if it would never end, and, observing the
  king look a little surprised, I informed the Marquess Conyngham,
  in a loud whisper, that this was the mode in which they expressed
  their sense of any honor conferred, and that the chief of the
  warriors would interpret the speech in the French language. The
  king asked me to repeat what I had been saying, and George and
  Irving conversed for some time. His majesty, on another occasion,
  asked me under what circumstances the Indians had been introduced
  to me. I answered that they were recommended to my notice,
  because they had been invested with the medallions of his late
  majesty by my brother.</p>

  <p>His majesty hoped the Indians had seen every thing remarkable
  in Windsor, and told us we were welcome to see the interior of
  the lodge and pleasure grounds, that Sir Andrew Barnard would
  accompany us everywhere, to his stables, menage<a name="Page_399"
  id="Page_399"></a>rie, aviaries, &amp;c., and afterwards he
  trusted we would partake of some refreshment. He also offered us
  the use of his carriages. The refreshment was a truly royal
  repast,&mdash;we eat on silver,&mdash;the table groaned, as Mr.
  Heathfield would say, under the king's hospitality. We made a
  famous dinner,&mdash;pine apple, champagne, claret,
  &amp;c.&mdash;servants in royal liveries behind our chairs. After
  dinner the Indians gave us the war song, when, (in your uncle
  Savery's poetry about Maria Easy,)</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Tho' the dogs ran out in a
  great fright,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ladies rushed in with much
  delight."</span><br /></p>

  <p>[NOTE.&mdash;These four Indians came to England for the
  purpose of endeavouring to recover lands which had been given to
  their tribe by Louis the Sixteenth, but it appears that they did
  not succeed. They were very pious Roman Catholics, and those who
  saw them were much amused with their simple and primitive
  manners.&mdash;ED.]</p>

    <p>QUEBEC, January 12, 1831.</p>

    <p>With my kindest love to the Tuppers, tell them that I often
    see Colonel Glegg, who was Sir Isaac <a name="Page_400" id=
    "Page_400"></a>Brock's aide-de-camp: he is now Lord Aylmer's
    civil secretary, and we meet very often. He speaks
    affectionately of his old patron, and has made many inquiries
    relative to the family: the tears come into his eyes when he
    talks to me of old times. He and George (Lieut.-Colonel Eliot)
    were a great deal together during the war in the Upper
    Province. The other day, at dinner at the ch&acirc;teau, he
    told me that he had had a visit from Sir Isaac's old
    housekeeper, who is still living here in a similar situation to
    the House of Assembly, and gets &pound;50 a year salary. He
    knew her directly, and seemed quite affected when telling me
    that she had brought her credentials with her in case he had
    not recognized her, as many years had elapsed since they met;
    and she opened a pocket book carefully, which she had in her
    hand, and took a piece of a shirt with the initials of General
    Brock's name, which she said she had cut off when the body was
    brought in to be buried at Fort George, and preserved it as a
    relic of her dear master. This little, trifling, affectionate
    remembrance of the old creature, shews her real attachment.
    Colonel Glegg gave her a new snuff box, filled with snuff from
    Paris, and told her to come again to see him. Perhaps the
    Tuppers will be pleased to hear this little anecdote.</p>
  </div>

  <p>[Mrs. Eliot, whose maiden name was Jane M'Crea, is the
  daughter of an American loyalist and a gallant field officer, now
  deceased, and the niece and namesake of the unfortunate Jane
  M'Crea, whose tragical fate in the American revolutionary war
  excited so much commiseration, and gave rise to a correspondence
  between the American general. Gates, and General Burgoyne. The
  former wrote: "Miss M'Crea, a young lady, lovely to the sight, of
  virtuous character and <a name="Page_401" id=
  "Page_401"></a>amiable disposition, engaged to an officer of your
  army, was, with other women and children, taken out of a house
  near Fort Edward, carried into the woods, and there scalped and
  mangled in a most shocking manner.... The miserable fate of Miss
  M'Crea was particularly aggravated by being dressed to receive
  her promised husband, but met her murderer employed by you." The
  latter, in his reply, stated, that "two chiefs, who had brought
  her off for the purpose of security, not of violence to her
  person, disputed which should be her guard, and in a fit of
  savage passion in one, from whose hands she was snatched, the
  unhappy woman became the victim."]</p>

  <p>We have in a preceding chapter described the monument, on
  Queenstown Heights, to the memory of Sir Isaac Brock, a monument
  which "the popularity of the general had caused to be regarded
  with more affectionate veneration than any other structure in the
  province." On Good Friday, the 17th of April, 1840,<a name=
  "FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> a miscreant of the
  name of Lett introduced a quantity of gunpowder into this
  monument with the fiendish purpose of destroying it; and the
  explosion, effected by a train, caused so much damage as to
  render the column altogether irreparable. Lett, who was by birth
  an Irishman and by settlement a Canadian, had been compelled to
  fly into the United States for his share in the recent rebellion;
  and "well knowing the feeling of attachment to the name and
  memory of General Brock, as pervading all classes of Canadians,
  he sought to gratify his own malicious and vindictive spirit, and
  at the same time to wound and insult the people of Upper Canada"
  by this demon's deed. The universal indignation of that people
  was aroused, and a public meeting was appointed to be held on
  Queenstown Heights, on the 30th of July following, for the
  purpose of <a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a>adopting
  resolutions for the erection of another monument, the gallant Sir
  Allan Mac Nab especially making the most stirring exertions to
  promote this great object. The gathering, as it was called, was
  observed in Toronto (late York) as a solemn holiday; the public
  offices were closed, and all business was suspended; while
  thousands flocked from every part of the province to testify
  their affection for the memory of one who, nearly thirty years
  before, had fallen in its defence! History, indeed, affords few
  parallels of such long cherished public attachment. "Steam
  vessels, engaged for the occasion, left their respective ports of
  Kingston and Coburg, of Hamilton and Toronto, in time to arrive
  at the entrance of the Niagara river about ten o'clock in the
  forenoon. The whole of these, ten in number, then formed in line,
  and ascended the river abreast, with the government steamer,
  containing the lieutenant-governor, Sir George Arthur, and his
  staff, leading the way. The British shore was lined with
  thousands, and the fleet of steamers filled with hundreds, each
  shouting and responding to the cheers of welcome from ship to
  shore, and from shore to ship again. The landing being effected,
  the march to the ground was accompanied by military guards, and a
  fine military band. The public meeting was then held in the open
  air, near the foot of the monument, and Sir George Arthur was in
  the chair. The resolutions were moved, and speeches made, by some
  of the most eminent and most elo<a name="Page_403" id=
  "Page_403"></a>quent men, holding high official stations in the
  province;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id=
  "FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class=
  "fnanchor">[142]</a> and considering that amidst this grand and
  imposing assemblage, there were a great number of veteran
  officers of the Canada militia, who had fought and bled with the
  lamented chief, whose memory they were assembled to honor, and
  whose monument they had come to re-establish over his remains,
  the enthusiasm with which the whole mass was animated may readily
  be conceived; while the grand and picturesque combination of
  natural objects of scenery, beheld from the heights on which they
  were met, and the brightness of the day, added greatly to the
  effect of the whole." The gathering<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id=
  "FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class=
  "fnanchor">[143]</a> was attended by about 8,000 persons, and the
  animation of the scene was increased by a detachment of royal
  artillery, who fired a salute; by a detachment of the 1st dragoon
  guards, with their bright helmets glittering in the sun; and by
  the 93d regiment, (Highlanders,) in full costume.</p>

  <p>There were altogether eleven resolutions, of which the fifth
  was the following:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Resolved,&mdash;That we recall to mind, with admiration and
    gratitude, the perilous times in which Sir Isaac Brock <a name=
    "Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>led the small regular force, the
    loyal and gallant militia, and the brave and faithful Indian
    warriors, to oppose the invaders&mdash;when his fortitude
    inspired courage, and his sagacious policy gave confidence, in
    despite of a hostile force, apparently overwhelming.</p>
  </div>

  <p>We cannot refrain from transferring to these pages parts of
  the long and eloquent speech of the chief justice, Robinson, who,
  on advancing to the front of the hustings to move the sixth
  resolution, was received with the most enthusiastic cheers.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>If it were intended by those who committed this shameful
    outrage, that the injury should be irreparable, the scene which
    is now before us, on these interesting heights, shews that they
    little understood the feelings of veneration for the memory of
    BROCK which still dwell in the hearts of the people of Upper
    Canada. No man ever established a better claim to the
    affections of a country; and, in recalling the recollections of
    eight and twenty years, there is no difficulty in accounting
    for the feeling which has brought us together on this occasion.
    Among the many who are assembled here from all parts of this
    province, I know there are some who saw, as I did, with grief,
    the body of the lamented general borne from the field on which
    he fell&mdash;and many who witnessed, with me, the melancholy
    scene of his interment in one of the bastions of Fort
    George.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id=
    "FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class=
    "fnanchor">[144]</a> They can never, I am sure, forget the
    countenances of the soldiers of that gallant regiment which he
    had long commanded, when they saw deposited in the earth the
    lamented officer who had for so many years been their pride;
    they can never forget the feelings displayed by the loyal
    militia of this province, when they were consigning to the
    grave the noble hero who had so lately achieved a glorious
    triumph in the <a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>defence of
    their country: they looked forward to a dark and perilous
    future, and they felt that the earth was closing upon him in
    whom, more than in all other human means of defence, their
    confidence had been reposed. Nor can they forget the
    countenances, oppressed with grief, of those brave and faithful
    Indian warriors, who admired and loved the gallant Brock, who
    had bravely shared with him the dangers of that period, and who
    had most honorably distinguished themselves in the field, where
    he closed his short but brilliant career.</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;" />

    <p>It has, I know, Sir, in the many years that have elapsed,
    been sometimes objected, that General Brock's courage was
    greater than his prudence&mdash;that his attack of Fort
    Detroit, though it succeeded, was most likely to have, failed,
    and was therefore injudicious&mdash;and that a similar rashness
    and want of cool calculation were displayed in the manner of
    his death.</p>

    <p>Those who lived in Upper Canada while these events were
    passing, can form a truer judgment; they know that what may to
    some seem rashness, was, in fact, prudence; unless, indeed, the
    defence of Canada was to be abandoned, in the almost desperate
    circumstances in which General Brock was placed. He had with
    him but a handful of men, who had never been used to military
    discipline&mdash;few, indeed, that had ever seen actual service
    in the field; and he knew it must be some months before any
    considerable reinforcement could be sent to him. He felt,
    therefore, that if he could not impress upon the enemy this
    truth, that&mdash;wherever a major-general of the British army,
    with but a few gallant soldiers of the line, and of the brave
    defenders of the soil, could be assembled against
    them&mdash;they must retire from the land which they had
    invaded, his cause was hopeless. If he had begun to compare
    numbers, and had reserved his small force in order to make a
    safer effort on a future day, then would thousands upon
    thousands of the people of the neighbouring <a name="Page_406"
    id="Page_406"></a>States have been found pouring into the
    western portions of this province; and when at last our mother
    country could send, as it was certain she would, her armies to
    our assistance, they would have had to expend their courage and
    their strength in taking one strong position after another,
    that had been erected by the enemy within our own
    territory.</p>

    <p>And at the moment when the noble soldier fell, it is true,
    he fell in discharging a duty which might have been committed
    to a subordinate hand; true, he might have reserved himself for
    a more deliberate and stronger effort; but he felt that
    hesitation might be ruin&mdash;that all depended upon his
    example of dauntless courage&mdash;of fearless self-devotion.
    Had it pleased Divine Providence to spare his invaluable life,
    who will say that his effort would have failed? It is true his
    gallant course was arrested by a fatal wound&mdash;such is the
    fortune of war; but the people of Canada did not feel that his
    precious life was therefore thrown away, deeply as they
    deplored his fall. In later periods of the contest, it
    sometimes happened that the example of General Brock was not
    very closely followed. It was that cautious calculation, which
    some suppose he wanted, which decided the day against us at
    Sackett's Harbour&mdash;it was the same cautious calculation
    which decided the day at Plattsburg; but no monuments have been
    erected to record the triumphs of those fields&mdash;it is not
    thus that trophies are won.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Hon. Mr. Justice Macaulay, in moving the third resolution,
  thus elegantly expressed himself:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>It was not my good fortune to serve in the field under the
    illustrious Brock, but I was under his command for a short
    period, when commandant of the garrison of Quebec, thirty years
    ago, and well remember his congratulating me upon receiving a
    commission in the army, accompanied with good wishes for my
    welfare, which I shall never forget. I feel myself a humble
    subaltern still when called <a name="Page_407" id=
    "Page_407"></a>upon to address such an auditory, and upon such
    a topic as the memory of Brock. Looking at the animated mass
    covering these heights in 1840, to do further honour to the
    unfortunate victim of a war now old in history, one is prompted
    to ask, how it happens that the gallant general, who has so
    long slept the sleep of death, left the lasting impression on
    the hearts of his countrymen which this scene exhibits; how
    comes it that the fame of Brock thus floats down the stream of
    time, broad, deep, and fresh as the waters of the famed river
    with whose waters, it might be almost said, his life's blood
    mingled? In reply, we might dwell upon his civil and military
    virtues, his patriotic self-devotion, his chivalrous gallantry,
    and his triumphant achievements. (Here one of the auditors
    added, "and that he was an honest man"&mdash;an attribute most
    warmly responded to on every side, for an honest man is the
    noblest work of God.) Still it might be asked, What peculiar
    personal qualities predominated and gave him the talismanic
    influence and ascendancy over his fellow men, which he acquired
    and wielded for his country's good? I answer, Are there any
    seamen among you? (Yes, yes, answered from the
    crowd)&mdash;then I say it was the Nelsonian spirit that
    animated his breast; it was the mind intuitively to conceive,
    and the soul promptly to dare, incredible things to feeble
    hearts&mdash;with a skill and bearing which infused this
    chivalrous and enterprising spirit into all his followers, and
    impelled them energetically to realize whatever he boldly led
    the way to accomplish. It displayed itself too, not only in the
    ranks of the disciplined soldiers, but in those also of the
    untrained militia of Upper Canada, as was amply proved on this
    memorable ground. Such were the shining and conspicuous
    qualities of the man that have rendered very dear his memory
    and his fame. Gentlemen, the resolution which I hold in my hand
    is expressive of the indignation felt throughout the province
    at the lawless act, the effects of which are visible before
    us.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a>After the resolutions had
  been carried by acclamation, and the public proceedings had
  terminated, 600 persons sat down to dinner in a temporary
  pavilion erected on the spot where the hero fell, "Chief Justice
  Robinson presiding; and at this, as at the morning meeting, great
  eloquence was displayed in the speeches, great loyalty evinced in
  the feelings, and great enthusiasm prevailed." After the queen's
  health had been drunk, the chief justice rose and said:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>I have now to propose the memory of the late gallant Sir
    Isaac Brock, of Colonel M'Donell, and those who fell with them
    on Queenstown Heights. That portion of you, gentlemen, who were
    inhabitants of Upper Canada while General Brock served in its
    defence, are at no loss to account for the enthusiastic
    affection with which his memory is cherished among us. It was
    not merely on account of his intrepid courage and heroic
    firmness, neither was it solely because of his brilliant
    success while he lived, nor because he so nobly laid down his
    life in our defence; it was, I think, that he united in his
    person, in a very remarkable degree, some qualities which are
    peculiarly calculated to attract the confidence and affection
    of mankind,&mdash;there was, in all he said and did, that
    honesty of character which was so justly ascribed to him by a
    gentleman who proposed one of the resolutions,&mdash;there was
    an inflexible integrity, uncommon energy and decision, which
    always inspire confidence and respect,&mdash;a remarkable union
    in his whole demeanour of benevolence and firmness,&mdash;a
    peculiarly commanding and soldierlike appearance,&mdash;a
    generous, frank, and manly bearing,&mdash;and, above all, an
    entire devotion to his country. In short, I believe I shall
    best convey my own impression, when I say it would have
    required much more courage to refuse to follow General Brock,
    than to go with him wherever he would lead.</p>
  </div>

  <p>"<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>The meeting presented a
  proud display of high and noble feelings, honorable to the memory
  of the dead, and equally so to the character of the living. It
  was conducted with great dignity and judgment, and no accident
  occurred to interrupt the pleasures of the day; the steam vessels
  re-embarking their passengers soon after sun-set, and conveying
  back the individuals composing this congregated multitude to
  their respective homes in safety."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id=
  "FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class=
  "fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

  <p>It having been resolved by the meeting that the most suitable
  monument, to replace the shattered column, would be an obelisk on
  the site of the mutilated structure, the committee offered a
  premium for a design, which, in February, 1843, was awarded to
  Mr. T. Young, architect to the university of king's college,
  Toronto. The style of the intended obelisk is the simplest and
  purest Egyptian, the artist having strictly avoided all
  minuteness of detail in order that the massive proportions of the
  design might harmonize with the bold and beautiful scenery by
  which it will be surrounded. The total height of the base,
  pedestal, and obelisk, will be 120 feet. The obelisk will measure
  at the lower base 16 feet 6 inches square, diminishing to 10 feet
  at the base of the upper, the proportions of that known as
  Cleopatra's needle having been strictly adhered to. The estimated
  cost of this obelisk is about &pound;5,000 currency, the
  materials <a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>of the old
  monument being used as far as possible; and as above
  &pound;4,000<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id=
  "FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class=
  "fnanchor">[146]</a> have already been contributed, it is
  expected that the new structure will be commenced in the spring
  of 1845.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id=
  "FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class=

  <p>A concluding notice of Sir Isaac Brock's favorite regiment
  will scarcely be deemed superfluous, although, as the records of
  the 49th were destroyed at the evacuation of Fort George, in May,
  1813, we cannot give many further details of its services
  previous to that period. In 1759, it assisted at the reduction of
  Fort Niagara, then held by the French, (page <a href=
  '#Page_160'>160</a>,) and it served in the American revolutionary
  war, as, by the records still existing, the flank companies were
  to be permitted to wear, the grenadiers a black, and the light
  company a red, feather, for services at Bunker's Hill; but the
  books being lost, the regiment cannot shew the authority, and
  consequently is not allowed this distinction. The 49th was
  repeatedly engaged in Upper Canada, and was especially
  distinguished at the battles of Stoney Creek and Chrystler's
  Farm. In 1815, the regiment returned to England, after an absence
  of above thirteen years; and in January, 1816, "in consequence of
  its doing duty over her royal highness the princess Charlotte of
  Wales, at Weymouth, she was graciously pleased to nominate it her
  regiment." In December, 1821, the 49th embarked for the Cape of
  Good Hope, and in 1828 proceeded on to Bengal. <a name="Page_411"
  id="Page_411"></a>In April, 1840, the regiment embarked for
  China, where it distinguished itself, and suffered much from
  climate. In gaining possession of the heights which overlook the
  city of Canton, on the 25th May, 1841, "as the two brigades
  advanced together, there was some little rivalry between the 49th
  and 18th regiments, as to which should have the honor of
  commencing the attack upon the two forts. The 49th, having the
  advantage of a shorter and perhaps rather better road, got the
  lead, which they maintained; so that the left brigade carried
  BOTH the eastern forts before the 18th came up, and with little
  loss."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id=
  "FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class=
  "fnanchor">[148]</a> In February, 1843, after the Chinese had
  been coerced into a peace, the 49th returned to Calcutta, and the
  following month embarked for England, where the head quarters
  arrived on the 24th August, after an absence of nearly twenty-two
  years&mdash;an example of the arduous services in which the
  British infantry of the line is constantly engaged. The 49th,
  (the Princess Charlotte of Wales',) or Hertfordshire regiment,
  bears on its colours and appointments the distinctions of Egmont
  op Zee, Copenhagen, Queenstown, the Dragon, and China.</p>

  <p>On the 27th August, 1844, new colours were presented to the
  49th, at Winchester, by Lady Pakenham, the wife of Major-General
  the Hon. Sir Hercules Pakenham, commanding the district, the
  colours being first consecrated by Doctor C. <a name="Page_412"
  id="Page_412"></a>R. Sumner, the Lord Bishop of Winchester, who
  thus addressed the troops:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Soldiers of the 49th, I have solicited and obtained
    permission of your gallant commanding officer to address you a
    few moments before I invoke the blessing of Almighty God upon
    the colours which are never to be sullied by any act of yours,
    and are not to be abandoned but with life itself. And let not
    any man marvel that I, a man of peace, come among you, who are
    men of war, for I hold that there is not a truer man of peace
    than a Christian soldier. When he conquers, it is not for
    national aggrandizement, nor the mere raising of your names,
    but for the insuring of peace in future time. Many a brave man
    has bled on the field, or expired on a bed of agony, that his
    countrymen might be preserved from the horrors of war. With
    respect to the services of the 49th, I might go back to a time
    antecedent to the present century. We must remember what a debt
    of gratitude we owe to your companions in arms for their
    prowess in many a well-fought field. And what did we not owe
    also to the naval power for the preservation of our soil from
    the insults and the cruelties of our enemy? I must bid you look
    back to the recollection of those days when you won glory in
    Holland, Copenhagen, and Canada, and since in India and China.
    I remember well the stirring phrases used by the great captain
    of the age, the commander-in-chief of the British army, the
    Duke of Wellington, when he asked for the thanks of parliament
    to the army of China&mdash;those were stirring phrases
    indeed&mdash;they were well worth living to hear, and well
    worth dying to deserve; they are for you to treasure up, and
    your children yet unborn to hear from your lips. When you
    unfold those banners, you look upon them as the memorials of
    former days, and in centuries yet to come they will be
    memorials of your country's renown, of your country's
    prosperity, and of your country's peace. On these grounds I
    hold that the <a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>Christian
    soldier is an instrument of good to the nation at large, and I
    bid you God speed in the name of the Lord, and, as a Christian
    bishop, I would bid you remember Him who is the God of battles,
    Him by whom nations are led to victory and preserved in peace.
    Be men of resolution and men of energy, pacific in your
    profession and disinterested in your patriotism, observant of
    your duty to your queen, your country, and your God.</p>

  <p>Of Sir Isaac Brock's brothers, the eldest, John, a brevet
  lieutenant-colonel in the 81st regiment, was killed in a duel, in
  July, 1801, at the Cape of Good Hope, by Captain
  M&mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id=

  a public ball, very properly resisted the introduction, by his
  antagonist, of a female of disreputable character. The second
  brother, Ferdinand, a lieutenant of the 60th regiment, was slain
  in the defence of B&acirc;ton Rouge, on the Mississippi, 21st
  September, 1779, at the early age of nineteen. The third brother,
  Daniel De Lisle, a man of distinguished ability, was bailiff and
  president of the States of Guernsey. No chief magistrate of the
  island was ever so beloved, honored, and regretted, as Mr. Brock;
  and so universal was the feeling of admiration for his talents
  and services, that the Royal Court decreed him a public funeral
  at the public expense&mdash;a tribute of respect never previously
  paid by that body to any individual.<a name="FNanchor_150_150"

  India," and a very powerful writer in support of the government

  entered his breast, in the disastrous retreat of the British army

  <p>Our memoir is concluded, and even if in its progress we have
  but feebly and imperfectly narrated the career and portrayed the
  character of him who is the subject, we trust that our labour has
  not been in vain, because we feel that we have rescued much from
  oblivion that was hitherto unknown and unrecorded. It was that
  feeling which prompted us to undertake this work; and, in
  completing our task, we are not without hope that the simple
  language of soberness and truth will be preferred to a memorial
  composed with more art, but dictated by less sincerity. And
  should we in the course of these pages have inadvertently fallen
  into undue panegyrism, that common error of biographers, our

  <p>The garrison of Michilimakinack, when surprised in 1763, (see
  page <a href='#Page_244'>244</a>,) consisted of the commandant,
  Major Etherington, two subalterns, and ninety soldiers; and there
  were four English traders there. Of these Lieutenant Jemette,
  about seventy soldiers, and one trader, were massacred; but the
  commandant, Lieutenant Leslie, and the remainder, were preserved
  by the Ottawas, and restored at the peace in 1764. The English
  trader, who beheld and described the massacre, was Alexander
  Henry, whose travels in Canada are cited at page 369.</p>

  <p>When peace was concluded at Detroit, by General Bradstreet,
  with the Indians, in 1764, Pontiac fled to the Illinois; (see
  pages <a href='#Page_164'>164</a> and <a href=
  '#Page_243'>243</a>;) but he appears subsequently to have joined
  the English, and to have received a handsome pension from them to
  secure his attachment. Carver, in his "Three Years Travels" in
  North America, relates that in 1767 Pontiac held a council in the
  Illinois, in which he spoke against the English, and that in
  consequence an Indian, who was attached to their cause, plunged a
  knife into his heart, and laid him dead on the spot.</p>

    <p>I received yesterday your letter of the 19th March.... The
    sight of your handwriting reminded me of old times, and brought
    back the recollection of scenes which almost appear to have
    taken place in another state of existence.... I made a tour in

    and reverence the monument at Queenstown, erected to the memory
    of one who was as brave as he was good, and a better man never

    <p>Fort Michilimakinack, July 17, 1812.</p>

    <p>On the 15th instant I received letters, by express, from
    Major-General Brock, with orders to adopt the most prudent
    measures either for offence or defence, which cir<a name=
    "Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>cumstances might point out; and
    having received intelligence from the best information, that
    large reinforcements were expected to be thrown into this
    garrison, with the thorough conviction that my situation at St.
    Joseph's was totally indefensible, I determined to lose no time
    in making the meditated attack on this fort.</p>

    <p>On the 16th, at ten o'clock in the morning, I embarked my
    few men, with about 180 Canadians, and two iron 6-pounders. The
    boats arrived without the smallest accident at the port of
    rendezvous, at three o'clock the following morning: by the
    exertions of the Canadians, one of the guns was brought up a
    height commanding the garrison, and ready to act about ten
    o'clock. A summons was then sent in; a copy of the capitulation
    which followed I have the honor to enclose. At twelve o'clock,
    the American colours were hauled down, and those of his majesty
    were hoisted. A committee has been appointed to examine into
    the state of the public stores.</p>

    <p>Enclosed also are the returns of the ordnance and military
    stores found in the fort, and the strength of the garrison. The
    greatest praise is due to every individual employed in the
    expedition; to my own officers I am indebted, in particular,
    for their active assistance in carrying all my orders into
    effect.</p>

  not to him</i>. 8vo. Montreal, July, 1815.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"<i>Then</i> or <i>before</i> was communicated to him
    (Major-General Brock) the information of that <i>deadly
    armistice</i> <a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>concluded by
    Sir George Prevost with General Dearborn, which had so fatal an
    effect upon all the future operations, and which tied up the
    hands of the gallant Brock from executing his intended plan of
    sweeping the American posts to Sackett's Harbour,
    inclusive&mdash;an operation that most certainly would have
    been then effected.</p>

    <p>"This armistice, proposed by Sir George Prevost, merits
    serious consideration, from its operation being so greatly in
    favor of the enemy at that time, and so disadvantageous to us.
    A period most precious to us, if we had profited by it with
    vigour, was thereby lost in inaction, and the enemy in
    consequence allowed to recover from the panic into which they
    were thrown by Hull's capture.</p>

    <p>"The transport of the American stores, ordnance, and
    provisions, of each of which they were much in want, not being
    prohibited by that armistice, was accordingly protected and
    facilitated by it on Lake Ontario and along the Niagara
    frontier beyond the enemy's most sanguine hopes, whilst their
    then only disposable and invading force, under General Hull, on
    the Detroit frontier, was left at full liberty to profit by
    circumstances, the armistice as to him being at his option.</p>

    <p>"Most fortunately, however, Hull's business was settled by
    capitulation before the armistice was known to General Brock or
    him; but had it reached him in time, he of course would gladly
    have accepted it, to gain delay for the arrival of
    reinforcements and a supply of provisions, from which would
    have resulted the salvation of his army, the prejudicial
    consequences whereof to us are incalcu<a name="Page_420" id=
    "Page_420"></a>lable; for, had a knowledge of it reached the
    Indian nations at that time, such a disgust and distrust would
    have been thereby excited as could never have been removed; and
    the first effect of which would have appeared in the immediate
    dispersion of the Indians, whose powerful and indispensable aid
    at that early period of the contest would have been totally
    lost to us.</p>

    <p>"Madison's rejection of this armistice was followed by that
    <i>chilling defensive system</i> which General Brock was
    instructed by Sir George to follow, and which palsied his
    operations until his country had to mourn over his fatal loss
    at the battle of Queenstown, on the 13th of October, 1812.</p>

    <p>"Such, however, was the impulse he had given, and the valour
    and zeal wherewith the regular troops, militia and Indians, had
    been inspired, that the valuable effects thereof survived him;
    and gave a brilliant victory on that day to his successor,
    General Sheaffe, a lover of armistices also, who, in proof
    thereof, made <i>one of his own</i>, which threw away most of
    the advantages of that victory; for he neglected (although
    strongly urged thereto) to take Fort Niagara, which could have
    been done on the afternoon of the day of the Queenstown battle,
    without loss, as the enemy had entirely, or almost entirely,
    then evacuated it: had he done this, and at the same time
    crossed over a part of his force to Lewistown, as he was urged
    to do, and as Brock would have done had he survived, the whole
    Niagara line would have been cleared of the enemy, and all our
    after disasters in that quarter prevented.</p>

    <p>"It has been urged in favor of Sir George's timid defensive
    system, that it was proper in order to avoid irritating the
    enemy, and thereby uniting them; as also, that his force was
    inadequate to offensive warfare. Now, no positions were ever
    more untenable, for to think of conciliating an enemy by
    leaving to him the full benefit of maturing in security all his
    means of annoyance against you, and at the same time muzzling
    yourself, is a most <a name="Page_421" id=
    "Page_421"></a>extraordinary doctrine; surely, to do so must
    ensure success to that enemy, as we know that success will
    unite discordant parties and interests, whilst defeats promote
    disunion, and would have strengthened the anti-war party in the
    States, by furnishing to them unanswerable arguments when
    depicting the folly and impolicy of the war, which had been so
    wantonly declared by the Madisonian party.</p>

    <p>"Were facts in support of this view of the subject
    necessary, they would be found in the effects upon the public
    mind in that country, produced by the capture of
    Michilimakinack and Detroit, with Hull's army. Did these events
    irritate and unite the enemy against us? No, they increased
    irritation, it is true, but against their own government."</p>

    <p>(In his tenth or concluding letter, Veritas recapitulated
    his preceding arguments, and observed:) "That to General
    Brock's zeal and energy, left as he was without orders, along
    with other causes independent of Sir George, the preservation
    of Upper Canada, in the first instance, and of Lower Canada as
    a consequence, are mainly to be ascribed."</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"The invasion of the Upper Province, undertaken so
    immediately after the declaration of war, shews in the
    strongest manner how fully they had prepared themselves for
    that event, and how highly they had flattered themselves with
    finding it an easy conquest, from the supposed weakness of the
    force opposed to them, and the spirit of disaffection which
    they had previously endeavoured to excite amongst its
    inhabitants. Foiled as they have been in this attempt by the
    brave and united efforts of the regular forces, militia, and
    Indians of that province, under the command of their
    distinguished leader, their whole <a name="Page_422" id=
    "Page_422"></a>army with its general captured, and their only
    remaining fortress and post in the adjoining territory wrested
    from them, it is not to be doubted but that the American
    government will keenly feel this disappointment of their hopes,
    and consequently endeavour to avail themselves of the surrender
    of Detroit, to term it an invasion of their country, and to
    make it a ground for calling upon the militia to march to the
    frontiers for the conquest of the Canadas. A pretext so weak
    and unfounded, though it may deceive some, will not fail to be
    received in its proper light by others; and it will be
    immediately perceived by those who will give themselves the
    trouble to reflect on the subject, that the pursuit of an
    invading army into their own territory, is but a natural
    consequence of the first invasion; and the capture of the
    place, to which they may retire for safety, a measure
    indispensably necessary for the security and protection of the
    country originally attacked."</p>

    <p>"To Colonel Brock, of the 49th, who commanded at the fort, I
    am particularly indebted for his kindness to me during the
    fortnight I remained at Niagara. Among many pleasant days which
    I passed with him and his brother officers, that of our visit
    to the Tuscorora Indians was not the least interesting. They
    received us in all their ancient costume; the young men
    exhibited for our amusement in the race, the bat game, &amp;c,
    while the old and the women sat in groups under the surrounding
    trees, and the picture altogether was as beautiful as it was
    new to me."&mdash;<i>Note in Moore's Epistles, Odes,
    &amp;c</i>.</p>

    <p>"At Queenstown the battle was fought in which General Brock
    fell, and the inhabitants point out a thorn bush at the bottom
    of the heights, where it is said that he received his mortal
    wound. His career was a short but a brilliant one; and had the
    direction of the affairs of the Upper Province, after his
    death, been characterized by an equal <a name="Page_423" id=
    "Page_423"></a>degree of courage, prudence, and humanity, a
    very different series of subsequent events would have claimed
    the attention of the historian."&mdash;<i>Duncan's Travels in
    the United States and Canada, in 1818 and 1819</i>.</p>

    <p>"Close to the spot where we landed in Canada, there stands a
    monument to the gallant General Brock, who was killed during
    the battle of Queenstown, in the act of repelling an invasion
    of the frontier by the Americans, during the late war.... The
    view from the top of the monument extended far over Lake
    Ontario, and showed us the windings of the Niagara, through the
    low and woody country which hangs like a rich green fringe
    along the southern skirts of that great sheet of
    water,"&mdash;<i>Captain Basil Hall's Travels in North America,
    in 1827 and 1828</i>.</p>

    <p>Travelling in the state of New York, the author observes:
    "The late Sir Isaac Brock was, by some accident, mentioned. The
    canal agent spoke of him in terms of great respect, as the best
    commander the British had ever sent to Canada&mdash;equally

      Queenstown, (seven miles,) near which a monument has been
      erected to the memory of Sir Isaac Brock, from the top of
      which, about 120 feet high, there is a noble view of Lake
      Ontario and the adjoining country, and thence to the village

      <p>"Immediately above Queenstown stands Brock's monument, on
      the heights where the battle was fought in which that hero
      was killed. His body was removed to it from Fort George, in
      1824. The view from this fine column is probably the most
      beautiful in Upper Canada."&mdash;<i>M'Gregor's British

      the same name, which have become famous in Canadian history
      as the scene of a battle wherein General Brock fell, is the
      village of Queenstown, pleasantly situated on the Niagara,
      and opposite to the American village of Lewistown. The
      monument, built to the memory of the gallant general and his
      companions, on the loftiest part of these heights, forms a
      prominent object to the numerous <i>voyageurs</i> who are
      constantly arriving at this portage, in elegantly fitted up
      steam boats, from York and Kingston, to view the neighbouring
      falls of the Niagara. The village contains a church, court
      house, large government stores, and a population of between
      400 and 500 inhabitants."&mdash;<i>The Canadas, by Andrew
      Pichen.</i></p>

      <p>"Leaving a garrison in Detroit sufficiently strong to keep
      the inhabitants in awe, General Brock lost no time in
      quitting the conquered post and hastening to Niagara&mdash;a
      command he had only relinquished for the purpose of
      undertaking an achievement which the gallantry and
      determination of his character could alone have crowned with
      such unqualified success....</p>

      <p>"The month of October was marked by an event of the most
      melancholy nature&mdash;the death of General Brock, who fell
      a victim to the intrepidity and daring of his character....
      The loss of their leader, however, cast a gloom over every
      English brow, and an advantage thus purchased was deemed at
      too high a price. General Brock was beloved by the soldiery,
      particularly the 49th, of which he had long been
      lieutenant-colonel, and the indignation of their grief for
      his loss cost the Americans many a life on that day, that had
      otherwise been spared. At Amherstburg, the account of his
      death was received with heartfelt concern, and not a man was
      there of those he had lately led to victory who failed to pay
      that tribute to his memory, which the gallantry and
      magnanimity of this glorious chief were so every way
      calculated to awaken in the breast of the
      soldier."&mdash;'<i>A Canadian Campaign</i>,' <a name=

      <p>"Immediately opposite the town of Prescott, on the shore
      of the United States, is the town of Ogdensburg; and twelve
      miles higher up, on the Canadian shore, stands the delightful
      village of Brockville, so called in honor of the late
      lamented Sir Isaac Brock. This enchanting little spot unites
      in its situation every beauty of nature. In front of it flows
      the river St. Lawrence, interspersed with numerous islands,
      variously formed and thickly wooded; behind it is an
      assemblage of small hills, rising one above another in 'gay
      theatric pride;' and on each side are a number of well
      cleared farms, in an advanced state of cultivation. Every
      thing combines to render it pre-eminently beautiful. The
      dwellings are built of wood, and tastefully painted; and the
      court house, in an elevated situation at the back of the
      village, seems, from its superior size, to be the guardian of
      the villagers&mdash;an idea of my fancy, which I did not seek
      to confirm by entering within its doors. Brockville contains
      450 souls. It has a parsonage house, but no church has
      hitherto been erected."&mdash;<i>Five Years in Canada, by
      E.A. Talbot.</i></p>

      <p>"We remained an hour or two at Brockville, the village of
      palaces; and few villages have I seen more attractive than
      this one. It is situated on a shelving bank, with a southern
      aspect, and groves of trees round it. The houses and churches
      are built of grey stones, and, being covered with tin, have a
      light and pleasant appearance." <i>Alexander's Transatlantic
      Sketches.</i> London, 1833.</p>
    </div>

    <p>[NOTE.&mdash;Brockville was originally named Elizabeth Town,
    in compliment to the general's mother, and the township or
    county, in which the village is situated, is still called
    Elizabeth. There is a large township bordering the river St.
    Clair and Lake Huron, in about latitude 43&deg; and longitude
    82&deg;, in the western district of Upper Canada, named Sarnia,
    the ancient name of Guernsey. This township was probably so
    named by Sir Isaac Brock.]</p>

    <p>"This chief of the branch of the once great tribe of the
    Hurons visited England some time ago. I afterwards saw him in
    Quebec, and had a good deal of conversation with him. When
    asked what had struck him most of all that he had seen in
    England, he replied, without hesitation, that it was the
    monument erected in St. Paul's to the memory of General Brock.
    It seemed to have impressed him with a high idea of the
    considerate beneficence of his great father, the king of
    England, that he not only had remembered the exploits and death
    of his white child, who had fallen beyond the big salt lake,

    <p>To His Royal Highness the Prince Regent of the United
    Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,</p>

    <p>The humble address of the Commons of Upper Canada, in
    Parliament assembled,</p>

    <p>May it please your Royal Highness,</p>

    <p>We, his majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects the
    Commons of Upper Canada, in Provincial Parliament assembled,
    beg leave to offer to your Royal Highness the homage of our
    unfeigned attachment to his Majesty's sacred person and
    government, and of our filial reverence for the great and
    magnanimous nation of which we have the honor to form a
    part.</p>

    <p>While we pray your Royal Highness to accept of our most
    cordial congratulations on the splendid achievements of his
    Majesty's forces, and of those of his allies in various parts
    of the globe, and in particular on the extraordinary successes
    which, under Divine Providence, have attended his Majesty's
    arms in this portion of his dominions; we should do injustice
    to the memory of our late truly illustrious president,
    Major-General Brock, under whose auspices the latter were
    during his lifetime principally achieved, did we omit to
    accompany them with feelings of the most poignant sorrow for
    his fall.</p>

    <p>He had endeared himself to us by his able, virtuous, and
    disinterested administration of the civil government, and by
    the zeal, military talent, and bravery, which characterized and
    marked his conduct in the field.</p>

    <p>To his energy, his promptitude, and his decision, do we feel
    ourselves in a great degree indebted, for having at this moment
    the happiness of enjoying the privileges of his Majesty's
    subjects. His disinterested and manly conduct aroused the
    spirit of the country, and called it forth for self-defence
    against a most insidious foe.</p>

    <p>In appreciating, as we do, his talents and eminent
    ser<a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a>vices, most deeply do
    we lament our inability to bestow on them any other reward than
    our praise. Without revenue for even the ordinary purposes of
    the government, we have no funds from whence to reward merit,
    however exalted and deserving.</p>

    <p>We derive, however, much pleasure from beholding that the
    services of our ever-to-be-lamented president and general have
    been appreciated by your Royal Highness; and while we feelingly
    regret that he did not survive to enjoy the high honors
    conferred upon him by your Royal Highness in his Majesty's
    name, we, with all humility, would beg to suggest that a grant
    to his family of a portion of his Majesty's most valuable waste
    lands in this province would be most gratifying to us. It
    would, we doubt not, be acceptable to them, and it would be the
    means of perpetuating the connection that had taken place
    between us, as well as the name of Brock, in a country in
    defence of which the general so nobly fell!!! and which his
    exertions had so eminently contributed to save.</p>

    <p>That your Royal Highness may long be preserved to fill the
    exalted station to which you have been called for the
    advancement of the happiness, honor and glory, of the British
    nation, is the fervent prayer of his Majesty's faithful
    subjects, the Commons of Upper Canada.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>One hearse, covered
    with black cloth, and drawn by four black horses, each with a
    leader, contained both the bodies. Soon after ten, a lane was
    formed by the 1st and 4th regiments of Lincoln militia, with
    their right on the gate of Fort George, and their left
    extending along the road towards Queenstown, the ranks being
    about forty paces distant from each other: within this line was
    formed, a guard of honor of the 76th regiment, in parade order,
    having its left on the fort. As the hearse moved slowly from
    the fort, to the sound of solemn music, a detachment of royal
    artillery began to fire the salute of nineteen guns, and the
    guard of honor presented arms.</p>

    <p>"As the procession passed along the lane of militia, the
    latter wheeled inwards by subdivisions in succession, as soon
    as its own front was clear, and followed the procession. At a
    certain distance from Fort George the <a name="Page_433" id=
    "Page_433"></a>quick march was taken up, and arms were sloped;
    the members of the procession then took their carriages,
    preserving as nearly as possible the order abovementioned, and
    the whole proceeded on the road to Queenstown. The 2d and 3d
    regiments of Lincoln militia, in like manner, formed a lane,
    its left resting on the heights, near the entrance to the
    monument, and extending along the road towards the village of
    Queenstown. On reaching the commencement of this lane, the
    procession resumed its formation, all horses, carriages,
    &amp;c., keeping in the rear; and when the head of the column
    approached the monument, it inclined to the right, to allow the
    body to proceed direct to the entrance. The guard of honor then
    halted and formed in parade order; the 2d and 3d Lincoln
    regiments following the procession in like manner as the 1st
    and 4th.</p>

    <p>"The time occupied in moving from the fort to Queenstown, a
    distance of nearly seven miles, was about three hours,
    including stoppages. Being arrived opposite the spot where the
    lamented hero received his mortal wound, the whole procession
    halted, and remained for a few minutes in solemn pause. It then
    ascended the heights, and to the spectator who had his station
    on the summit near the monument, nothing could be finer than
    the effect of the lengthened column winding slowly up the steep
    ascent in regular order, surrounded by scenery no where
    surpassed for romantic beauty. On the bodies being removed from
    the hearse and deposited in the vault, the guard of honor
    presented arms, whilst the artillery, (which had been taken
    from the enemy during the last war,) posted on the heights,
    fired a salute of nineteen guns. The troops then marched in
    ordinary time round the monument, and immediately separated to
    their respective parades.</p>

    <p>"All those who were inclined to visit the interior of the
    vault were then permitted to enter in small parties. The
    remains of the brave M'Donell lie to the left of those of
    <a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a>the general. On the
    general's coffin, which is otherwise quite plain and covered

    of several hundreds, copies of the inscription to be placed on

    amongst the assembled multitudes, and which is as follows:</p>

    <p>"The Legislature of Upper Canada has dedicated this Monument
    to the very eminent civil and military services of the late Sir
    Isaac Brock, Knight of the Most Hon. Order of the Bath,
    Provisional Lieutenant-Governor, and Major-General commanding
    the Forces in this Province, whose remains are deposited in the
    vault beneath. Having expelled the North Western Army of the
    United States, achieved its capture, received the surrender of
    Fort Detroit, and the territory of Michigan, under
    circumstances which have rendered his name illustrious, he
    returned to the protection of this frontier; and advancing with
    his small force to repel a second invasion of the enemy, then
    in possession of these heights, he fell in action, on the 13th
    of October, 1812, in the forty-third year of his age, honoured
    and beloved by the people whom he governed, and deplored by his
    Sovereign, to whose service his life had been devoted."</p>

  <p>REMARKS.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"By the best computation we could make, and avoiding all
    exaggeration, at the time the procession reached the monument
    there could not be less than five thousand persons present,
    many of whom were from the United States. General Brock,
    indeed, was a man no less esteemed by the enemy than he was
    admired and almost adored by his friends and soldiery; and we
    heard several Americans say, who had served against him and saw
    him fall, that they lamented his death as much as they would
    have done that of any of their own generals, on account of his
    humanity, and the great attention he had uniformly shewn to his
    prisoners.</p>

    <p>"His excellency the lieutenant-governor (Major-General Sir
    Peregrine Maitland, K.C.B.) was in full dress, and, we are
    happy to say, appeared in good health after his late fatiguing
    journey of inspection to the Lower Province. The two M'Donells
    and Captain Dickinson, of the 2d Glengary regiment, relatives
    of the deceased Lieut. <a name="Page_436" id=
    "Page_436"></a>Colonel M'Donell, in the highland costume,
    appeared in the procession to great advantage, and seemed to
    excite much attention.</p>

    <p>"But, amongst the assembled warriors and civilians, none
    excited a more lively interest than the chiefs of the Indian
    nations from the Grand River, whose warlike appearance,
    intrepid aspect, picturesque dress and ornaments, and majestic
    demeanour, accorded well with the solemn pomp and general
    character of a military procession&mdash;amongst these, young
    Brant, Bears Foot, and Henry, were distinguished. In our mind
    we never saw a dress more elegant of its kind, and fit for
    active service in the woods, than that worn by young Brant,
    who, with his tomahawk in hand, was a perfect resemblance of
    all that could be imagined of the accomplished Indian
    warrior.</p>

    <p>"Amongst the numerous gentlemen in the procession, we
    observed that old veteran, Lieutenant M'Dougall, of his
    majesty's 8th (the king's) regiment, who, like a brave and
    loyal man, came from Sandwich to attend the
    re-interment."&mdash;<i>Upper Canada Gazette</i>,

    <p>"Queenstown, at which place the steam boats start for
    Toronto, is situated in a delicious valley, through which the
    Niagara river, in colour a deep green, pursues its course. It
    is approached by a road that takes its winding way among the
    heights by which the town is sheltered, and, seen from this
    point, is extremely beautiful and picturesque. On the most
    conspicuous of these heights stood a monument, erected by the
    provincial legislature in memory of General Brock, who was
    slain in a battle with the American forces, after having won
    the victory. Some vagabond, supposed to be a fellow of the name
    of Lett, who is now, or who lately was, in prison as a felon,
    blew up this monument two years ago; and it is now a melancholy
    ruin, with a long fragment of iron railing banging dejectedly
    from its top, and waving to and fro <a name="Page_437" id=

    is of much higher importance than it may seem that this statue
    should be repaired at the public cost, as it ought to have been
    long ago; firstly, because it is beneath the dignity of England
    to allow a memorial, raised in honor of one of her defenders,
    to remain in this condition, on the very spot where he died;
    secondly, because the sight of it in its present state, and the
    recollection of the unpunished outrage which brought it to this
    pass, are not very likely to soothe down border feelings among
    English subjects here, or compose their border quarrels and

  <p><i>Revolutionary Services of General Hull, as taken from his
  Defence before the Court Martial</i>, <i>in March</i>, 1814.</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"For more than half a century I supported a character
    without reproach. My youth was devoted to the service of my
    country; I fought her battles in that war which achieved her
    liberty and independence, and which was ended before many of
    you, gentlemen, who are my judges, were born. If upon any
    occasion a man may speak of his own merits, it is at such a
    time as this; and I hope I may be permitted to present to you,
    in very few words, a narration of my life, while I was engaged
    in scenes which were calculated to prove a man's firmness and
    courage. I shall do it with less reluctance, because the
    testimony I have offered of the venerable men who served with
    me in the revolutionary war, will vouch for all I have to say.
    In the year 1775, at the age of about twenty-one years, I was
    appointed a captain in one of the Connecticut regiments; during
    that campaign, and until March, 1776, when the enemy evacuated
    Boston, I served with the army at Cambridge and Roxbury, and in
    the immediate command of General Washington. I was with that
    part of the army, in March, 1776, which took possession of
    Dorchester heights&mdash;the movement which compelled the enemy
    to evacuate Boston. The next day, the regiment to which I
    belonged marched for New York. I was on Long Island when the
    enemy landed, and remained until the night the whole army
    retreated. I was in several small skirmishes, both on Long
    Island and York Island, before the army retired to the White
    Plains. I then belonged to Colonel Charles Webb's regiment, of
    Connecticut.</p>

    <p>"This regiment was in the severest part of the action on
    Chatterdon's Hill, a little advanced of the White Plains, a few
    days after the main body of the army abandoned New York. This
    battle is memorable in the history <a name="Page_439" id=
    "Page_439"></a>of our country; and the regiment to which I
    belonged received the particular thanks of General Washington,
    in his public orders, for its bravery and good conduct on the
    occasion. It was particularly distinguished from all the other
    troops engaged in the action. I received a slight wound by a
    musket ball in my side, but it did not prevent me from
    remaining at the head of my company.</p>

    <p>"I was in the battle of Trenton, when the Hessians were
    taken, in December, 1776; and, being one of the youngest
    captains in the army, was promoted by General Washington the
    day after the battle, to a majority, for my conduct on that
    occasion. The 1st of January, 1777, I was in the battle of
    Princeton. In the campaign of the same year, the regiment to
    which I belonged served in the northern army. I was early in
    the spring ordered to Ticonderoga, and commanded the regiment
    (being the senior officer present) under General St. Clair, and
    I was with that officer in his retreat from that post.</p>

    <p>"After General St. Clair's army formed a junction with
    General Schuyler's army on the North River, at Fort Edward, the
    regiment to which I belonged was detached, and marched to Fort
    Schuyler, and relieved that post, which was besieged by General
    St. Leger.</p>

    <p>"On the retreat of General Schuyler's army from Fort Edward,
    I commanded the rear guard of the army; and, being two miles in
    the rear, was attacked by a large body of British troops and
    Indians at daylight in the morning, in which action were killed
    and wounded between thirty and forty of my guard. And I
    received the particular thanks of General Schuyler for my
    conduct on the occasion.</p>

    <p>"I was in the two memorable battles, on the 19th of
    September and the 7th of October, on Bemis' heights, against
    General Burgoyne's army, previous to its surrender. In the
    action of the 19th of September, I commanded a detachment of
    three hundred men, who fought the principal part of the
    afternoon, and more than one half of them were killed or
    wounded.</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a>On the 7th of October,
    I likewise commanded a detachment from the brigade which
    assisted in attacking the enemy on the left of our position,
    defeated him, followed him to the right of his lines, stormed
    his entrenchments, and took and held possession of the right of
    his position, which compelled him to retreat to Saratoga, and
    there to capitulate.</p>

    <p>"After the memorable event of the capitulation of General
    Burgoyne's army, the regiment to which I belonged was ordered
    to Pennsylvania, to join the army under the command of General
    Washington. I remained with the army the winter of 1777, at
    Valley Forge; and in the spring of 1778, when the British army
    evacuated Philadelphia, I was in the battle of Monmouth.</p>

    <p>"From December, 1778, to May, 1779, I commanded the American
    posts in advance of the White Plains, near Kingsbridge, during
    which time I had various skirmishes with the enemy. In May,
    1779, the principal part of the British army advanced up the
    North River to Verplank's and Stoney Point, and I was ordered
    to retreat before them to West Point.</p>

    <p>"I then joined the light infantry, under the command of
    General Wayne, and was in the memorable attack on Stoney Point,
    with a separate command of four hundred light infantry.</p>

    <p>"For my conduct on this occasion I received the particular
    thanks of General Wayne, General Washington, and congress.</p>

    <p>"In the summer and autumn of 1780, I commanded the advanced
    posts of the army; and in December of that year, I commanded an
    expedition against the enemy, stationed at Morrissina, which
    was successful, and for which I received the thanks of General
    Washington, in his general orders to the army, and likewise the
    thanks of congress. General Washington, in his orders, I well
    remember, made use of these words: 'He thanked me for my
    judicious arrangements in the plan of operations, and for my
    intrepidity and valour in the execution.'</p>

    <p>"<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a>From the conclusion of
    the revolutionary war I have lived with the respect of my
    countrymen, and have enjoyed repeated marks of their confidence
    in the offices which have been bestowed upon me. When I found
    that the independence, for which I had so often fought, was
    assailed,&mdash;that again my country must appeal to arms to
    avenge her wrongs, and to protect her rights,&mdash;I felt that
    I might yet do her some service. For though many years had
    passed since I had fought under her standard, and though my own
    arm might not have had its wonted strength, yet my spirit was
    unbroken, and my devotion to her unimpaired. I thought in the
    field, where there could be but few who had any military
    experience, what I had learned in the most active scenes of a
    seven years' war, might be useful. I fondly hoped that in my
    age, as well as in my youth, I might render services that
    should deserve the gratitude of my country&mdash;that if I fell
    by the sword of her enemies, my grave would be moistened with
    the tears of my countrymen; that my descendants would be proud
    of my name and fame. But how vain is anticipation! I am now
    accused of crimes which would blast my former honors, and
    transmit my memory with infamy to posterity. And in that
    hideous catalogue, there is none from the imputation of which
    my nature and my feelings have more recoiled than from that of
    cowardice, to which I am to answer."</p>

    <p>"The appearance of General Hull was venerable and
    prepossessing. Beneath snowy locks, of nearly sixty winters'

  <p><i>Letter from Captain Wool to Colonel Van Rensselaer.</i></p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"BUFFALOE, October 23, 1812.</p>

    <p>"I have the honor to communicate to you the circumstances
    attending the storming of Queenstown battery, on <a name=
    "Page_442" id="Page_442"></a>the 13th instant; with those which
    happened previously you are already well acquainted.</p>

    <p>"In pursuance of your order, we proceeded round the point
    and ascended the rocks, which brought us partly in rear of the
    battery. We took it without much resistance. I immediately
    formed the troops in rear of the battery, and fronting the
    village, when I observed General Brock with his troops formed,
    consisting of four companies of the 49th regiment, and a few
    militia, marching for our left flank. I immediately detached a
    party of one hundred and fifty men, to take possession of the
    heights above Queenstown battery, and to hold General Brock in
    check; but in consequence of his superior force they retreated.
    I sent a reinforcement; notwithstanding which, the enemy drove
    us to the edge of the bank: when, with the greatest exertions,
    we brought the troops to a stand, and ordered the officers to
    bring their men to a charge as soon as the ammunition was
    expended, which was executed with some confusion, and in a few
    moments the enemy retreated. We pursued them to the edge of the
    heights, when Colonel M'Donell had his horse shot from under
    him, and himself was mortally wounded. In the interim, General
    Brock, in attempting to rally his forces, was killed, when the
    enemy dispersed in every direction. As soon as it was
    practicable, I formed the troops in a line on the heights
    fronting the village, and immediately detached flanking
    parties, which consisted of Captain Machesney, of the 6th
    regiment, Lieutenant Smith and Ensign Grosvenor, with a small
    detachment of riflemen, who had that moment arrived; at the
    same time, I ordered Lieutenant Ganesvoort and Lieutenant
    Randolph, with a detachment of artillery, to drill out an
    18-pounder which had been previously spiked, and, if possible,
    to bring it to bear upon the village. The wounded and prisoners
    I ordered to be collected, and sent to the guard-house. About
    this time, which was about three or four o'clock in the
    afternoon, Lieut.-Colonel Christie arrived, and took the
    command. <a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a>He ordered me
    across the river to get my wounds dressed. I remained a short
    time. Our flanking parties had been driven in by the Indians;
    but General Wadsworth and other officers arriving, we had a
    short skirmish with them, and they retreated, and I crossed the
    river."</p>

    <p>[NOTE.&mdash;Captain Wool, in stating that he was opposed to
    four companies of the 49th, <i>only</i> doubled the number of
    companies; but this exaggeration is a trifle compared with the
    following gross and <i>hudibrastic</i> mis-statements, relative
    to the battle of Queenstown in "Ramsay's History of the United
    States," viz: "The 49th British regiment, signalized in Egypt
    under Colonel, since Lieut.-General, Brock, and usually called
    the 'Egyptian Invincibles,' was among the prominent corps, and
    was led by its favorite commander. In the second engagement,
    this regiment of British regulars, 600 strong, encountered a
    body of 320 American regulars, supported by a few militia and
    volunteers, the whole under Colonel Chrystie. They mutually
    resorted to the bayonet, and after a bloody conflict, the
    famous invincibles yielded to the superior energy of their
    antagonists, although the latter were so far inferior in
    numbers. They were rallied by Lieut.-General Brock, who was
    killed in conducting them a second time to the charge. The
    American prisoners were kindly treated by this brave regiment,
    who, after the battle was over, acknowledged they had never
    opposed more gallant adversaries."&mdash;The 49th, not having
    been with the British army in Egypt, could not be called the
    "Egyptian Invincibles;" and instead of this regiment, 600
    strong, being led by Major (not Lieutenant) General Brock, only
    the flank companies were present, with a small body of militia,
    together about 300 men. In fact, four companies of the 49th
    were at Kingston, 160 miles distant, and the remaining four
    battalion companies were, we believe, at Fort Erie, 27 or 28
    miles from Queenstown; and therefore, the assertion that the
    "famous invincibles" yielded to far Inferior numbers, is
    something worse than ridiculous. Such, however, is the
    correctness of this American historian on the subject, and with
    such materials is history too often compiled.&mdash;ED.]</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Captain Wool discovered the British troops forming at
    Queenstown, and formed the troops under his command in line.
    General Brock was at the head of the British troops, and led
    them round about to the heights in the rear of the battery.
    Captain Wool detached 160 men to meet the British; this
    detachment was driven <a name="Page_444" id=
    "Page_444"></a>back, reinforced, and the whole driven to the
    brink of the precipice, forming the bank of the Niagara river,
    above Queenstown.</p>

    <p>"At this moment some of the officers put a white
    handkerchief on a bayonet to hoist as a flag, with intention to
    surrender. Captain Wool inquired the object. It was answered
    that the party were nearly without ammunition, and that it was
    useless to sacrifice the lives of brave men. Captain Wool tore
    off the flag, ordered the officers to rally the men, and bring
    them to the charge. The order was executed, but in some
    confusion. The boasted 49th could not stand the American
    bayonet. The British troops were routed, and Major-General
    Brock, in gallantly exerting himself to rally them, was killed.
    His aid, Colonel M'Donell, fell mortally wounded at the same
    time.</p>

      probably without an equal in the whole range of English
      literature: "His body was solemnly exposed in the midst of
      the plain, under a silken pavilion; and the chosen squadrons
      of the Huns, wheeling round in measured evolutions, chaunted
      a funeral song to the memory of a hero, glorious in his life,
      invincible in his death, the father of his people, the
      scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the world."</p>

  <p>DANIEL DE LISLE BROCK, ESQ.</p>

  <p>BAILIFF OF GUERNSEY.</p>

  <p>This able magistrate, the third son of John Brock, Esq., was
  born in Guernsey on the 10th December, 1762, and closed a long
  and useful career on Saturday evening, the 24th September, 1842,
  at the age of 79 years and nearly 10 months. After receiving such
  rudiments of education as the island could furnish in those days,
  he was placed at Alderney, to learn the French language, under M.
  Vallatt, a Swiss protestant clergyman, and a man of talent, who
  was afterwards rector of St. Peter-in-the-Wood, in Guernsey. From
  Alderney he was sent to a school at Richmond, in Surrey, where he
  remained only two years, as at the early age of fourteen he went
  to Dinan with his father, who died there. The early death of his
  parent was an irreparable loss to the son, as it was the cause of
  his not returning to school, where he had already shown that he
  possessed a vigour of intellect much beyond his years. His two
  elder brothers were in the army, and the pardonable fondness of
  his mother induced her to retain at home the only one of her
  sons, who could in some measure replace the counsels of her
  husband.</p>

  <p>In 1785, he went by sea to the Mediterranean, and spent
  upwards of a year in visiting Spain, Malta, Sicily, Italy,
  Switzerland, and France. In 1798, he was elected jurat <a name=
  "Page_446" id="Page_446"></a>of the Royal Court; and the greater
  part, if not the whole, of the public documents of that body,
  were from that period written by him. In 1821, he obtained the
  high and responsible appointment of bailiff, or chief magistrate
  of Guernsey.</p>

  <p>"It has been truly said that the history of Guernsey, for the
  last fifty years, was, in fact, the history of Daniel De Lisle
  Brock. So exclusively has the better part of Mr. Brock's life
  been devoted to the service of his country&mdash;so completely
  have his affections been wrapped up in her welfare&mdash;so
  ardently, so zealously, and so unceasingly has he laboured to
  promote her prosperity and to protect her privileges&mdash;and so
  intimately has he been connected with all the important
  occurrences of the period alluded to&mdash;that in reading the
  history of the island, we read the history of this the most able
  and devoted of its friends."</p>

  <p>Between the years 1804 and 1810, Mr. Brock was deputed by the
  States and Royal Court of Guernsey no less than four times, as
  their representative to government, in matters connected with the
  trade and privileges of the island; and he also went once to
  Jersey, to confer with the Royal Court there on the same subject.
  In these missions, Mr. Brock distinguished himself by his
  luminous and argumentative papers,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id=
  "FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class=
  "fnanchor">[161]</a> and the authority of the Royal Court was
  happily preserved intact by his representations and unremitting
  exertions.</p>

  <p>"In 1821, an act of parliament having been passed prohibiting
  the importation of foreign corn into the Channel Islands,
  whenever its entry for consumption was prohibited in England, to
  wit, until it reached the price of 80s. per quarter, Mr. Brock
  was again deputed to London to contend against a measure fraught
  with such fatal consequences to the islands, and at the same time
  to obtain some modifications in the navigation laws. Mr. Brock,
  <a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a>who was essentially assisted
  in this business by Mr. James Carey, jurat, succeeded in both
  these objects. The obnoxious corn law was repealed so far as the
  Channel Islands were concerned, and some important privileges
  conceded to their trade and navigation, especially in granting
  them free intercourse with the British colonies, and the American
  continent and islands. So highly were these last services
  appreciated, that when Mr. Brock returned to Guernsey, on the
  24th July, 1822, he was received with unexampled enthusiasm. On
  landing in the morning, he was saluted with deafening cries of
  "<i>Brock for ever!</i>" "<i>Long may he live!</i>" &amp;c. The
  public joy was manifested on this occasion in many different
  ways. The shipping in the harbour hoisted their flags; crowns and
  garlands of flowers, flags, loaves of bread, with ears of corn,
  were tastefully arranged, and suspended in almost every street;
  mottos and devices, expressive of unbounded gratitude, were
  exhibited in every direction, and in the greatest variety; and
  the church bells throughout the island rang merry peals during
  the day. Bands of music paraded the town, followed by crowds, on
  whose happy countenances "Mirth, admit me of thy crew," was
  expressed. The musicians wore various coloured bands round their
  hats, with the motto of "<i>Long live Bailiff Brock!</i>" They
  surrounded a banner crowned with flowers, bearing the following
  inscription:</p>

  <p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"The grateful inhabitants of
  Guernsey, to the worthy Bailiff,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">DANIEL DE LISLE
  BROCK.</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Happy is he who labours to
  promote the happiness of his fellow</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">citizens.</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">He will secure their eternal
  gratitude. They will unceasingly</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">exclaim: 'May God preserve oar
  friend, our benefactor, and our</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">parent.'"</span><br /></p>

  <p>"This inscription having been borne in triumph in every part
  of the town, was presented to the object of well-merited praise,
  and accepted. Preparations had been made by the militia bands to
  receive this distinguished patriot at the landing place; but
  their good intentions <a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a>were
  thwarted, in consequence of the early hour at which the arrival
  took place. At a public meeting of the inhabitants, it was
  determined to present a piece of plate to Mr. Brock, as a
  testimony of the value attached to his public services, and in
  the hope that this faint evidence of their attachment might serve
  to stimulate others to follow his steps, and might descend as a
  memorial to his posterity. Upwards of &pound;300 were quickly
  raised for this purpose, and other less valuable, but not less
  gratifying, testimonials were presented to him. Nor was Jersey
  less grateful, as a public meeting was held in the town of St.
  Helier, when the thanks of the island and a handsome piece of
  plate were unanimously voted to him."</p>

  <p>In 1826, General Sir John Doyle, Bart, and G.C.B., for many
  years lieutenant-governor of Guernsey, visited the island, and at
  a public dinner, given to him on the 29th August, at the Assembly
  Rooms, he rose and spoke as follows:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>Gentlemen,&mdash;Having received permission from the chair,
    I rise to propose a toast which would be well received in any
    society where the enlightened individual is known. But here I
    anticipate it will be met by acclamation and enthusiasm. I do
    not propose his health, merely because he is my friend,
    although I feel truly honored by his friendship; and the more
    so, as I know that it originated and was cemented by his
    conviction of my honest zeal for the public good, and the deep
    interest I took in the welfare of his native land. But I give
    him as a public man, who, to a sound, vigorous, and cultivated
    understanding, joins a liberal and enlightened mind&mdash;an
    innate love of justice, and hatred of oppression&mdash;an
    inflexible adherence to that which appears to him to be
    right&mdash;a man too wise to be cunning. Armed with the
    '<i>mens conscia recti</i>,' he marches straightforward to his
    object, nor turns into the devious path of crooked policy, and
    left-handed wisdom. To these qualities are added indefatigable
    industry, and a patience not to be exhausted. This is the man,
    who, as a public magistrate in high station, I offer for your
    acceptance. Of his private worth, I dare not say all that I
    feel. He is present. You know him, and can duly appreciate his
    value. You will have anticipated that I mean the bailiff of
    Guernsey. I now propose to you 'The health of the bailiff, and
    unalloyed happiness to the island of Guernsey.'"</p>
  </div>

  <p>"<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a>In 1832, one of the most
  ancient and vital privileges of Guernsey&mdash;the right of the
  inhabitants to be tried in their own local court&mdash;was placed
  in peril, it being assailed by no less a character than Lord
  Chief Justice Tenderden, who sought to extend the power of the
  writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to this island. The history of this
  event would occupy much more space than we can now devote to it.
  Suffice it here to say, that after much correspondence on the
  subject, Mr. Brock and Mr. Charles De Jersey, the king's
  procureur, were deputed to London, to act in conjunction with the
  bailiff and procureur of Jersey in opposing the measure. The
  mission was successful, and the independence of the insular
  jurisdictions was maintained.</p>

  <p>"The last occasion on which Mr. Brock went to England in the
  service of his native island, was in the year 1835, when the
  channel islands were menaced with being deprived of the privilege
  of sending their corn into England, duty free. An idea had
  obtained ground that this privilege was abused; and, in
  consequence, a bill was brought into parliament to deprive the
  islands of this important branch of their trade. Deputies were
  therefore appointed by the islands to proceed to London, for the
  purpose of advocating their rights, and Mr. Brock was again fixed
  on as the representative of Guernsey. Owing to the remonstrances
  of this deputation, a select committee of the House of Commons
  was appointed to inquire into the matter, and the result was that
  the bill was withdrawn. So highly were Mr. Brock's services on
  this occasion valued by both islands, that the States of Jersey
  voted him a piece of plate of the value of &pound;100, whilst the
  States of Guernsey voted that portrait which now adorns the
  interior of the court-house, and which will afford to succeeding
  generations the means of contemplating the intellectual
  countenance and venerable form of one whom they will ever
  remember as the firmest friend, and ablest administrator of his
  country.</p>

  <p>"<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a>From the period here
  alluded to, until within a few days of his death, Mr. Brock was
  unremittingly engaged in labouring for the public good. The
  records of the island will show how indefatigably be devoted
  himself to its service; and it may be truly said of him, that to
  his latest moment the desire to secure its welfare was the
  reigning impulse of his heart."</p>

  <p>Mr. Brock left one son, Eugene, a captain in the 20th
  regiment, since deceased, unmarried; and one daughter, now also
  unmarried. In countenance and robustness of frame, although not
  so tall, as well as in vigour of intellect and decision of
  character, the bailiff strongly resembled his brother, Sir Isaac
  Brock; and when a friend of the latter, Sir James Kempt, visited
  Guernsey, in his official capacity as master-general of the
  ordnance, he was struck with the personal resemblance,
  notwithstanding that Mr. Brock was then in his 71st year.</p>

  <p>The Royal Court, having met on the 26th September, to appoint
  a judge delegate to replace <i>pro tempore</i> the late bailiff,
  unanimously requested the family of the deceased to allow him to
  be buried at the expense of the States of Guernsey, and the
  funeral was in consequence a public one. "For though Mr. Brock
  had enriched his country with numerous and inappreciable
  benefits&mdash;though he bequeathed to it an inestimable heritage
  in his deeds and in his example&mdash;he died in honorable and
  ennobling poverty, resulting from his disinterestedness, his
  integrity, and his patriotism.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id=
  "FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class=
  "fnanchor">[162]</a> The public, we say, were pleased, were
  gratified, were proud in seeing that their representatives and
  rulers so promptly and so handsomely anticipated and fulfilled
  their wishes, and they <a name="Page_451" id=
  "Page_451"></a>looked forward to the moment of paying to their
  departed benefactor the last mournful honors with feelings in
  which complacency was not unmingled with their grief.</p>

  <p>"Some hours before the time appointed for the ceremony, the
  inhabitants of the country parishes, mostly clothed in
  respectable mourning, were seen thronging into town; and by
  eleven o'clock a considerable crowd was collected in the front of
  Mr. Savery Brock's house, from whence the procession was to
  issue. Punctually at the time appointed, (twelve o'clock,) the
  authorities and other gentlemen invited to take part in the
  ceremony, together with a large number of persons who attended
  spontaneously to pay the last mark of respect to the deceased,
  were assembled; and having been marshalled by the deputy sheriffs
  and the special constables, in the manner laid down in the
  programme, the mournful <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>, comprising nearly
  500 persons, issued into the Grange Road in the following order
  of procession:</p>

  <p>"The procession proceeded in solemn order down the Grange
  Road, until it reached the College, when it turned to the left,
  and passed on to the eastern entrance of the new burying ground,
  and from thence proceeded to the grave, near the opposite
  extremity of the cemetery, which was destined to be the final
  resting place of the aged patriot. The persons who composed the
  <i>cort&egrave;ge</i> having been formed in order round the
  grave, the sublime and solemn ritual of the Church of England was
  read in a feeling and impressive manner by the Very Reverend the
  Dean, the coffin being at the proper period of the service
  committed to the bosom of the earth in profound and solemn
  silence. When the service was concluded, a great many persons
  approached the border of the grave to take a farewell look at the
  narrow tenement which now con<a name="Page_453" id=
  "Page_453"></a>tained the remains of a man who, but a few short
  hours back, had occupied so prominent a position in his native
  land. Many a sigh was breathed, many a tear was shed upon that
  grave; and many and various were the expressions of affection and
  regret which there found utterance, and which seemed to say</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>'We ne'er shall look upon his like again.'</p>
  </div>

  <p>"On no similar occasion had there ever been collected so large
  a concourse of persons in this island. Some pains were taken to
  ascertain the number of those who entered the burial ground, and
  it is believed that they considerably exceeded 4,000. An equal,
  or perhaps a larger number, were dispersed, as spectators, in the
  Grange Road and adjacent parts. Every house that commanded a
  glimpse of the procession, or the interment, was crowded. The
  windows, even, to the attics, were peopled; whilst walls,
  gardens, and every spot from which any thing could be seen, were
  in like manner occupied. Notwithstanding the extraordinary number
  of persons collected, a very creditable degree of order and
  decorum was maintained throughout the whole of the
  proceedings."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id=
  "FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class=
  "fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

  <p>The union jack was hoisted half mast at Fort George and Castle
  Cornet from the day succeeding the bailiff's death to that of his
  funeral, on which days also the bells of the parish church of St.
  Peter-Port were tolled, and the flags of the vessels in the two
  harbours and roadstead were hoisted half mast. On the day of the
  interment, the shops in St. Peter-Port were entirely closed until
  the mournful ceremony was completed.</p>

  <p>The lieutenant-governor of the island, Major-General Napier,
  the celebrated historian of the Peninsular war, evinced, in a
  manner as creditable to his feelings as it was gratifying to
  those of the family, an anxious desire to pay every respect to
  the memory of the deceased, his excel<a name="Page_454" id=
  "Page_454"></a>lency, with the officers of his staff, and
  Lieut.-General Ross, and Lieut.-General Sir James Douglas,
  ex-lieutenant-governors, attending the funeral in full uniform,
  as did all the officers of the garrison, and the officers of the
  five regiments of militia. All the civil and military
  authorities, as well as the whole of the clergy of the island,
  were present.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>The following remarks are extracted from a long and ably
  written article of nearly two columns, in the Guernsey
  <i>Star</i> of Monday, September 26, 1842, in which the last
  moments and character of Mr. Brock were feelingly portrayed by
  the editor, an English gentleman:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Mr. Brock's career, his talents, his services, and his
    amiable qualities, are so familiar to every native and
    inhabitant of Guernsey&mdash;they have, as it were, become so
    much the common property of the community&mdash;they have been
    so much the objects of their study&mdash;so constantly the
    theme of their praise and admiration&mdash;that it may seem
    almost a work of supererogation in us to make any observation
    on them on the present melancholy occasion. We cannot, however,
    allow the grave to close upon him without strewing it with some
    of those offerings of respect and praise which spontaneously
    spring to our hand as we pen the notice of his death. We feel
    that we enjoy considerable latitude on this occasion, because,
    from having been for years the political antagonists of Mr.
    Brock, and having braved his hostility when living, our tribute
    to his memory cannot be looked on as other than the genuine
    offspring of our feeling and our judgment.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brock was not an ordinary man. He was constituted of
    materials which would have led their owner to distinction in
    whatever sphere he might have been placed. Indebted but little
    to early education, he possessed within himself a faculty of
    extracting knowledge from every thing that came within his
    observation; and, gifted with a powerful memory, a reflecting
    mind, and the art of methodizing and arranging the ideas and
    information which he acquired, he was enabled at all times to
    bring a mass of well digested and pertinent knowledge to bear
    upon and illustrate any subject which he was required to
    discuss. He had a singular talent for comprehending principles
    and for seizing information, and arranging and applying it; so
    that there were few subjects upon which he entered on which he
    could not lay down sound principles, and illustrate and
    maintain them by sound arguments. Too confident of his
    strength, and per<a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a>haps
    over-elated with his many victories, he would sometimes venture
    on untenable ground, and expose himself to the inroads of an
    able enemy; but these indiscretions were of rare occurrence,
    and the memory of his temporary checks was generally cancelled
    by the skilfulness of his retreats.</p>

    <p>"If Mr. Brock was thus distinguished for his mental powers,
    he was no less so by the strength and felicity of his style of
    writing. He had the rare talent of putting proper words in
    their proper places. He wrote English with English plainness
    and English force. There was nothing affected or <i>modish</i>
    in his manner. He gave his readers an impression that he was
    clear in the conception of his own meaning, and he made it
    equally so to them. He aimed at no ornament: the beauty of his
    writings consisted in their perspicuity and strength. A verbal
    critic might discover inaccuracies in his compositions, but the
    man of sense would find in them nothing unmeaning&mdash;-
    nothing useless&mdash;nothing vapid. He was not a turner of
    fine periods&mdash;he was not a <i>fine writer</i>&mdash;but he
    wrote with strength, precision, and lucidity; and his
    compositions, even where they failed to produce conviction,
    could never be read without creating respect for the masculine
    talents of their author......</p>

    <p>"But the main ground on which the memory of Daniel De Lisle
    Brock must rest its claims on the affection, the respect, and
    the gratitude of his fellow countrymen, is the
    devoted&mdash;the engrossing love which, during his whole life,
    he bore to his native land. Every thought, every wish, every
    feeling of pride or ambition, centered in his beloved Guernsey.
    She was the idol of his affections&mdash;the object of all his
    solicitude&mdash;the glory of his inmost heart. His endeavours
    for her welfare may occasionally have been
    misdirected&mdash;his objections to change in her institutions
    may have been ill-founded&mdash;but his motives have ever been
    beyond the reach of suspicion or reproach. They were
    concentrated in the desire for her good. Her people, her soil,
    her laws, her customs, nay, even her prejudices, were dear to
    him&mdash;they were his household gods. He worshipped them, he
    lived for them, and he would have died for them......</p>

    <p>"The private character of Mr. Brock presents an embellishing
    and graceful adjunct to his public qualities. Bold even to
    temerity in his acts; firm even to obstinacy in his opinions;
    entertaining an exalted estimate of the office that he filled,
    and of the interests that he embodied or represented in his
    person, he was, at the same time, simple, courteous, and
    benevolent in his private manner, to a degree that was as
    honorable to himself, as it was gratifying to those who came in
    contact with him. Mr. Brock on the bench, and Mr. Brock in
    private, were distinct characters. In the former position,
    conscious, probably, of his talents and his authority, he was
    firm, and sometimes, though rarely, in appearance even
    imperious; in the latter, <a name="Page_456" id=
    "Page_456"></a>resigning himself to the feelings of the
    gentleman, he was affable, kind, and even diffident. In his
    privacy he displayed all the attributes of a superior mind. He
    was entirely devoid of pride and ostentation: his mind was
    superior to the weakness they denote. He disdained the
    conventional habits of society, for nature had created him a
    gentleman, and he needed not the aid of art. He mingled not in
    that society where he might have received the homage to which
    his talents were entitled. He spent his time in study, or in
    working for the public welfare; his relaxations being in his
    fields and garden, or in the conversation of casual visitors
    who, uninvited, occasionally resorted to his unceremonious and
    hospitable roof. Ardent as he was in political discussions,
    prone as he was to enter into controversy, the feelings of
    animosity which he expressed died in their utterance. The
    adversary of to-day was the welcome guest of the morrow. The
    hand which had distilled the gall of disputation at one moment,
    was readily extended in kind fellowship the next. Mr. Brock was
    probably not exempt from failings, but he had certainly nothing
    of littleness about him. He respected an honorable and open
    adversary, more than a flattering and servile friend. His
    hostility was strong, but it was shortlived: his enmity was
    vigorous, but it had no memory. In other respects, too, he
    evinced a generous and benevolent heart. At all seasons and
    under all circumstances, his time and attention were willingly
    devoted to those who sought his assistance or advice. He was
    the friend and counsellor of all. Many is the angry feeling he
    has allayed&mdash;many the lawsuit he has prevented&mdash;many
    the family division he has closed. His kind offices were at the
    command of all. No labour was too great for him, when called on
    for his assistance; but if at any time he found himself obliged
    to reject a claim which was made on him, he so softened his
    refusal with courtesy and kindness, that the disappointed
    seldom left him without experiencing a sense of obligation.</p>

    <p>"Possessing these characteristics, which are hastily
    sketched by the pen of a political opponent, Mr. Brock, it must
    be admitted, was a distinguished man. His sphere of action was
    limited, but within that sphere he acted an honorable, a
    useful, and a noble part. Had he been cast upon a wider stage,
    there can be little doubt that his talents and his resolution
    would have acquired for him a more extensive reputation; but,
    even as it is, his fate is enviable. He sought the welfare of
    his country, and desired its respect and gratitude as his
    reward. Both objects have been attained; and he now sleeps, at
    the close of a long and honorable life, regarded by all his
    country men as the most able, the most useful, the most
    disinterested, and the most patriotic of the rulers to which
    its destinies have ever been committed. No man has been more
    beloved and respected in his life, and none more regretted at
    his death. <i>Peace to his manes!</i>"</p>

  <p>The common ancestor of the Guernsey family of this name was
  John Tupper, who settled in the island about the year 1592. He
  was an English gentleman, of German, extraction, his forefather,
  it appears, having, about the year 1525, fled from Cassel during
  the religious persecution in the reign of Charles the Fifth. The
  elder son of this John Tupper married Elizabeth, daughter of
  Hilary Gosselin,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id=
  "FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class=
  "fnanchor">[164]</a> procureur du roi, or
  attorney-general&mdash;the younger removed to England.</p>

  <p>In the memorable year of 1692, John Tupper, Esq., (the
  grandson of the said John Tupper and Elizabeth Gosselin,) at some
  expense and risk of capture, conveyed to Admiral Russell, who
  commanded the combined English and Dutch fleets lying at St.
  Helen's, the intelligence that the French fleet, under Admiral
  Tourville, was in the channel. This intelligence led to the
  battle of La Hogue; and as a reward for this patriotic service,
  Mr. Tupper was presented by his sovereigns, William and Mary,
  with a massive gold chain and medal, which are now in possession
  of his heir male; his descendants being permitted to bear them as
  an honorable augmentation to their arms and crest.</p>

  <p>The elder son of John Tupper, who acquired the medal, by his
  wife, Elizabeth Dobr&eacute;e, of Beauregard, had three sons, of
  whom the eldest died without issue; the second was Elisha, a
  much-respected jurat of the Royal Court, <a name="Page_458" id=
  "Page_458"></a>who died in 1802, leaving five surviving
  children;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id=
  "FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class=
  "fnanchor">[165]</a> and the youngest was John, who obtained, in
  1747, a commission, by purchase, in General Churchill's regiment
  of marines, that corps being then differently constituted to what
  it is now. He served as a captain at the celebrated defeat of the
  French fleet in Quiberon bay, by Sir Edward Hawke, in 1759; as a
  major and commandant of a battalion at Bunker's Hill, in
  1775,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id=
  "FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class=
  "fnanchor">[166]</a> where he was slightly wounded, and where the
  marines, having greatly distinguished themselves, won the laurel
  which now encircles their device; and as a lieutenant-colonel in
  Rodney's victory of the 12th of April, 1782, having been
  especially sent from England to command the marines in the fleet,
  about 4,000 men, in the event of their being landed on any of the
  enemy's West India islands. At his decease, in January, 1795, he
  was a major-general in the army, and commandant-in-chief of the
  marines. Had the honors of the Bath been extended in those days
  to three degrees of knighthood as they have been since, he would
  probably have been a knight commander of that order.</p>

  <p>The fatality which has attended the descendants of the two
  brothers just named, will appear in the following brief
  summary:</p>

  <p>1.&mdash;Lieutenant Carr&eacute; Tupper, of his majesty's ship
  Victory, only son of Major-General Tupper, slain at the siege of
  Bastia, on the 24th of April, 1794.</p>

  <p>2.&mdash;William De Vic Tupper, (son of E. Tupper, Esq.)
  mortally wounded in 1798, in a duel in Guernsey, with an officer
  in the army, and died the day following.</p>

  <p>3.&mdash;John E. Tupper, aged twenty, perished at sea, in
  1812, in the Mediterranean, the vessel in which he was a <a name=
  "Page_459" id="Page_459"></a>passenger, from Catalonia to
  Gibraltar, having never been heard of since.</p>

  <p>4.&mdash;Charles James Tupper,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id=
  "FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class=
  "fnanchor">[167]</a> aged sixteen, captain's midshipman of his
  majesty's 18-gun brig Primrose, drowned on the 17th August, 1815,
  at Spithead, by the upsetting of the boat in which he was
  accompanying his commander, Captain Phillott, to the ship.</p>

  <p>5.&mdash;Lieutenant E. William Tupper, of his majesty's ship
  Sybille, aged twenty-eight, mortally wounded in her boats, June
  18, 1826, in action with a strong band of Greek pirates, near the
  island of Candia.</p>

  <p>6.&mdash;Colonel William De Vic Tupper, Chilian service, aged
  twenty-nine, slain in action near Talca, in Chile, April 17,
  1830. The four last sons of John E. Tupper, Esq., and Elizabeth
  Brock, his wife; and nephews of William De Vic Tupper, Esq.,
  already named, and also of Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, K.B.;
  of Lieut.-Colonel John Brock, and of Lieutenant Ferdinand Brock,
  who all fell by the bullet.</p>

  <p>7.&mdash;Colonel William Le Mesurier Tupper, of the British
  Auxiliary Legion in Spain, and a captain in the 23d, or Royal
  Welsh Fusiliers, mortally wounded near San Sebastian, May 5,
  1836, aged thirty-two. Colonel Tupper was also nephew of W. De
  Vic Tupper, Esq., and first cousin of the four brothers last
  named.</p>
  <hr style="width: 65%;" />

  <p>LIEUT. E. WILLIAM TUPPER, R.N.</p>

  <p>This promising young officer, third son of John E. Tupper,
  Esq., by Elizabeth Brock, his wife, was educated at Harrow, and
  commenced his naval career in 1810, in the Victory, of 110 guns,
  under the care and patronage <a name="Page_460" id=
  "Page_460"></a>of the late Lord de Saumarez, with whom he
  continued some time in the Baltic. He served on the American
  coast during the latter part of the war, in the Asia, 74; and was
  present at the disastrous attack of New Orleans, in January,
  1815, forming one of a party landed from the fleet, to co-operate
  with the army. On the night of the storm, this party, in
  conjunction with the 85th light infantry, under Colonel
  Thornton,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id=
  "FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class=
  "fnanchor">[168]</a> attacked some fortified works on the right
  bank of the Mississippi, and were completely successful; but the
  failure of the main assault rendered this success unavailing. In
  the same year he joined the flag ship of Sir Thomas Fremantle,
  who, having been an intimate friend of his late uncle, Sir Isaac
  Brock, kindly assured him of his influence and support; but peace
  taking place before he had attained the requisite age for
  promotion, all the bright prospects with which he entered the
  service were blighted. In November, 1817, on his return in the
  Active frigate, Captain Philip Carteret, from the Jamaica
  station, he passed at the naval college at Portsmouth, and was
  one of four midshipmen complimented as having undergone a
  superior examination. In 1823, he was appointed to the Revenge,
  Sir Harry Neale's flag ship, in the Mediterranean, and placed on
  the admiralty list for advancement. Early in 1826, he was at
  length promoted into the Seringapatam frigate; but Sir John
  Pechell, under whom he had previously served for a short time,
  prevailed upon the admiral to transfer him to his own ship, the
  Sybille, of 48 guns, "a crack frigate," in a high state of
  discipline, the crew of which was remarkable for its skill in
  gunnery.</p>

  <p>The Sybille was at Alexandria, when intelligence arrived there
  of the plunder of a Maltese vessel, under atrocious
  circumstances, by a nest of Greek pirates, on the southern coast
  of Candia. Sir John Pechell set sail immediately in quest of
  these lawless and desperate men. On Sunday, the 18th of June,
  1826, at daylight, two <a name="Page_461" id=
  "Page_461"></a>misticoes were observed under sail, near Cape
  Matala, standing towards the frigate; but on discovering their
  mistake, they made for the land, and were followed by the
  Sybille, into a narrow creek formed by a rocky islet and the
  mainland of Candia. On this islet were posted from 200 to 300
  armed Greeks, chiefly the crews of three or four piratical
  misticoes at anchor in the creek; and in a desperate attempt to
  cut out these misticoes, with the boats, Midshipman J.M. Knox and
  twelve men were killed; and the first lieutenant, Gordon,
  dangerously; Lieutenant Tupper, mortally; Midshipmen William
  Edmonstone and Robert Lees, both very severely; and twenty-seven
  men were wounded, of whom five died in a few days. Two of the
  misticoes were afterwards sunk, and many of the pirates were
  killed and wounded by the frigate's guns.<a name=
  "FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href=
  "#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tupper commanded the launch, and although severely
  wounded in three places, he stood up the whole time, and retained
  the command of her until he returned to the ship. The bullet,
  which proved fatal, entered his right breast, and was extracted
  from under the skin over the false ribs. He lingered until the
  26th June, when he breathed his last, in a state of delirium, on
  board the Sybille, at Malta, where his remains were interred, and
  a monument was erected to his memory by his captain and
  messmates. In person he was rather above the middle height, with
  a pleasing and intelligent countenance; and when his brother
  Charles and he were midshipmen together in the Victory, in the
  Baltic, they were designated on board as the handsome
  brothers.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id=
  "FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class=
  "fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

  <p>The surgeon of the Sybille, in a letter to the family in
  Guernsey, wrote of Lieutenant Tupper:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"When I first saw him he was firm and cool. He asked me to
    give my opinion without reserve, and knowing him to be
    possessed of</p>
  </div><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a>great fortitude, I
  told him that the wound in the chest was of a most
  <i>dangerous</i> nature, but not <i>necessarily</i> fatal. He had
  by this time lost a great deal of blood, but the internal
  hemorrhage, though the most alarming, was slight. He remained so
  low for three days, that it was expected he would have sunk,
  though he still continued collected and firm. On the fourth day
  he rallied, his pulse became more distinct, and he evidently
  encouraged hopes. Need I say that I felt myself incapable of
  destroying them&mdash;indeed I was not altogether without hope
  myself. The principal danger was from hemorrhage upon the
  separation of the sloughs, and my fears were fatally verified,
  for on the 25th, at noon, it commenced and increased internally,
  until his lungs could no longer perform their functions, and he
  died at about three o'clock on the morning of the 26th. During
  the whole time he was resigned, evincing the greatest strength of
  mind. As it was with unfeigned sorrow that I saw a fine and
  gallant young man fall a victim to such a cause, so it was with
  admiration that I witnessed his heroic bearing when the
  excitement was past, and hope itself was almost fled. I have seen
  many support their firmness amidst danger and death, but it
  belongs to few to sustain it during protracted suffering, which
  is indeed a trial often too severe for the bravest, but through
  which your lamented brother came with a spirit and resignation
  which reflected lustre upon himself and family, and endeared him
  to all his shipmates."

  <p>This highly gifted young man was a brother of the subject of
  the preceding memoir, their father having had ten sons and three
  daughters. He received an excellent education in England, partly
  under a private tutor in Warwickshire; and on the restoration of
  the Bourbons, in <a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a>1814, he
  was sent to a college in Paris, in which he continued until the
  arrival of Napoleon from Elba, when he was gratified by a glimpse
  of that extraordinary man. When he landed in France, although he
  had barely completed his fourteenth year, his stature was so tall
  and athletic as to give him the appearance of a young giant; and
  on being asked his age at the police office, that it might be
  inserted in his passport, his reply was received with a smile of
  astonishment and incredulity, which afforded much subsequent
  amusement to his elder fellow travellers. At the age of sixteen
  his strength and activity were so great, that few men could have
  stood up against him with any chance of success. On his return to
  Guernsey, every interest the family possessed was anxiously
  exerted to indulge his wish of entering the British army, but
  owing to the great reductions made after the peace of 1815, he
  was unable to obtain a commission, even by purchase. Those
  relatives, who could best have forwarded his views, had been
  slain in the public service; and in that day few claims were
  admitted, unless supported by strong parliamentary influence. He
  attended the levee of the commander-in-chief, who promised to
  take his memorial into early consideration; and it was hoped by
  the family that his tall and strikingly handsome person would
  have had some influence; but unfortunately the youth, then under
  sixteen, waited alone on the Duke of York, and had no one to
  plead his cause or to promote his wishes. He was accompanied as
  far as the Horse Guards by the late Lieut.-Colonel Eliot, (see
  page 399,) who there, or in the neighbourhood, introduced him to
  Sir Roger Sheaffe, whom they met accidentally; but the general
  took little or no notice of the nephew of one to whom he was
  under much obligation, and whose fall had been his rise. It is
  true that Sir Roger Sheaffe was also about to solicit an ensigncy
  for his own nephew; but sure we are, that had Sir Isaac Brock met
  the nephew of a gallant predecessor under similar circumstances,
  he would have presented him <a name="Page_464" id=
  "Page_464"></a>to the commander-in-chief, and urged his claims
  with all the warmth of companionship and gratitude. And is it not
  painful to think, that a nephew of Sir Roger Sheaffe obtained
  that <i>without</i> purchase, which was withheld from the nephew
  of Sir Isaac Brock, even <i>by</i> purchase&mdash;and that nephew
  of as noble a spirit as ever breathed? Being thus cruelly
  disappointed, young Tupper spent two or three years in Catalonia,
  of which province a relative, P.C. Tupper, was British consul
  (see page <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>); and "the young Englishman"
  received the public thanks of the municipality of Barcelona, for
  having boldly exposed his life to extinguish a conflagration
  which threatened to destroy a whole barrier of the city. Here his
  vanity was constantly excited by exclamations in the streets, on
  the manly beauty of his person. The profession of arms continuing
  his ruling passion, he embarked at Guernsey late in 1821 for Rio
  de Janeiro, whence he proceeded to Buenos Ayres, and thence over
  land to Chile, then struggling for her independence of Spain. His
  family was averse to his joining the patriot cause, as it was
  then termed, and he arrived at Santiago a mere soldier of
  fortune&mdash;without, we believe, a single letter of
  introduction to those in authority. But his appearance and
  manners, and a perfect knowledge of three languages, English,
  French, and Spanish, all of which he spoke fluently, soon
  procured him friends and active military employment. He rose
  rapidly, and his deeds have been compared to those of the
  far-famed Sir William Wallace.</p>

  <p>In a necessarily brief notice, it is, however, quite
  impossible to detail the services of young Tupper in the land of
  his unhappy adoption; and it must, therefore, suffice to say that
  he displayed the greatest talent and bravery, first against the
  Spaniards, and, after their subjugation, in the civil wars which
  ensued. He was drawn into the latter, when, in 1829, part of the
  troops, under General Prieto, attempted to subvert the existing
  authorities, because, as he wrote, he "considered that no free
  government or <a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a>orderly state
  could exist an hour, if the military were once allowed to throw
  the sword into the scale, and decide points of legislation by the
  force of arms." In a battle fought near the capital, Santiago,
  the rebel troops were defeated, but Prieto gained that by
  treachery, which he could not effect by the sword; and when
  Colonel Tupper resigned in disgust, the earnest entreaties of his
  old commander, General Freire unfortunately induced him to accept
  the government of Coquimbo, which step soon after compelled him
  to resume the command of his regiment. Freire was deceived by
  some of Prieto's chiefs, who, probably at the instigation of that
  faithless general, had promised to pass over to him with their
  troops at the first convenient opportunity; and he allowed
  himself to be forced into a battle on a vast plain at Lircay,
  near Talca, on the 17th April, 1830. Nothing could be more
  ill-judged or imprudent, as his army, which consisted of about
  1,700 men, had only two weak squadrons of regular cavalry and
  four pieces of artillery, while that of Prieto, amounting to
  fully 2,200 men, had 800 veteran cavalry, and eleven or twelve
  pieces of artillery. The Chile cavalry is very formidable, the
  men being most expert riders, mounted on active and powerful
  horses, and generally armed with long lances, which they use with
  great dexterity. After a long engagement, Freire's cavalry,
  consisting of about 600 men, including militia and Indians, fled
  completely discomfited, and abandoned the infantry, composed of
  three weak battalions, to its fate. Their situation was now
  indeed desperate, as the ground was so favorable to cavalry, and
  the neighbourhood offered them no accessible place of defence or
  refuge. When they formed into squares to resist the hostile
  cavalry, they were mowed down by artillery; and, when they
  deployed into line, the cavalry was upon them. In this dreadful
  emergency they maintained the conflict for nearly an hour, with
  all the obstinacy of despair; and at length, in attempting to
  charge in column, they were completely <a name="Page_466" id=
  "Page_466"></a>broken. The loss in Freire's army fell chiefly on
  the devoted infantry, and included eighteen officers among the
  killed. The only officers mentioned as slain, in Prieto's hurried
  dispatch of the 17th of April, are Colonel Elizalde, chief of the
  staff; Colonel Tupper, and his gallant Major Varela, a young man
  of five or six and twenty. Colonel Tupper is said to have
  exhibited the most reckless valour during the day, and to have
  rallied his battalion several times. Having dismounted to
  encourage his men, he was unable, in the
  <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> when all was lost, to find his horse;
  and the accounts of the manner of his death are so contradictory,
  that it is impossible to reconcile them. All agree, however, in
  stating that he was particularly sought after, and that orders
  were given to shew him no quarter. Certain it is that he was
  overtaken, and "sacrificed to the fears of Prieto, who justly
  considered him the sword and buckler of the irresolute and
  vacillating Freire." He was pronounced by an English traveller,
  as "the handsomest man he had ever seen in either hemisphere,"
  and undoubtedly his tall, athletic, and beautifully proportioned
  person, his almost Herculean strength, the elegance of his
  manners, and his impetuous valour in battle, gave the impression
  rather of a royal knight of chivalry, than of a republican
  soldier.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id=
  "FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class=
  "fnanchor">[171]</a> The influence and popularity which in a few
  short years he acquired in his adopted country, by his own
  unaided exertions, and under the many disadvantages of being a
  stranger in a strange land, best prove that his talents were of
  the first order, and that he was no common character. And that
  fraternal affection may not <a name="Page_467" id=
  "Page_467"></a>be supposed to have dictated this eulogium, the
  following impartial testimonies of its correctness are appended,
  in justice to the memory of one whom a combination of cruel
  circumstances drove to a distant land to shed that blood, and to
  yield that life, winch he had in vain sought to devote to his own
  country.</p>

  <p>An English gentleman, of ancient family, and author of travels
  in South America, who knew Colonel Tupper intimately, thus wrote
  of him:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"He was certainly one of the finest fellows I ever
    knew&mdash;one of those beings whose meteor-like flame
    traverses our path, and leaves an imperishable recollection of
    its brilliancy.... I have often held him up as an example to be
    followed of scrupulous exactness, and of a probity, I fear,
    alas! too uncompromising in these corrupt times."</p>
  </div>

  <p>The American <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> and
  consul-general in Chile, said, in a letter to Captain P.P. King,
  then of his majesty's ship Adventure, both strangers to the
  family:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"The heroism displayed by Tupper surpassed the prowess of
    any individual that I ever heard of in battle; but, poor
    fellow! he was horribly dealt with after getting away with
    another officer. A party of cavalry and Indians was sent in
    pursuit, and they boast that poor Tupper was cut to pieces.
    They seemed to be more in terror of him, on account of his
    personal bravery and popularity, than of all the others.
    Guernsey has cause to be proud of so great a hero&mdash;a hero
    he truly was, for nature made him one."</p>
  </div>

  <p>And one of the British consuls in Chile wrote:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"I trust you will believe that any member of the family of
    Colonel Tupper, who may require such services as I am at
    liberty to offer, will be always esteemed by one who, for many
    years, has looked upon his gallant and honorable conduct as
    reflecting lustre upon the English name in these new and
    distant states."</p>
  </div>

  <p>An anonymous French traveller, who published in a Paris
  newspaper, <i>Le Semeur</i>, of the 4th April, 1832, his
  "Souvenir d'un S&eacute;jour au Chili," thus expressed
  himself:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"Les Chiliens sont jaloux des &eacute;trangers qui prennent
    du service chez eux, et il est assez naturel qu'ils le soient,
    quoiqu'on ne puisse nier qu'ils aient de grandes obligations
    &agrave; plusieurs de ceux qui ont fait Chili leur patrie
    adoptive. Depuis mon retour en Europe, un de ces hommes, digne
    d'une haute estime, a cess&eacute; de vivre. Je veux <a name=
    "Page_468" id="Page_468"></a> parler du Colonel Tupper, qui a
    &eacute;t&eacute; fait prisonnier &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de son
    regiment; et qui, apr&egrave;s avoir &eacute;t&eacute; tenu,
    pendant une heure, dans l'incertitude sur son sort, fut
    cruellement mis &agrave; mort par les ennemis. Le Colonel
    Tupper &eacute;tait un homme d'une grande bravoure et d'un
    esprit &eacute;clair&eacute;; ses formes &eacute;taient
    athl&eacute;tiques, et l'expression de sa physionomie pleine de
    franchise. II se serait distingu&eacute; partout o&ugrave; il
    aurait &eacute;t&eacute; employ&eacute;, et dans quelque
    situation qu'il e&ucirc;t &eacute;t&eacute; plac&eacute;.
    N'est-il pas d&eacute;plorable que de tels hommes en soient
    r&eacute;duits &agrave; se consacrer &agrave; une cause
    &eacute;trang&egrave;re?</p>

    <p>"J'esp&egrave;re que le temps n'est pas
    &eacute;loign&eacute; o&ugrave; l'on saura appr&eacute;cier au
    Chili le patriotisme et l'&eacute;nergie, dont le Colonel
    Tupper a donn&eacute; l'exemple."</p>
  </div>

  <p>And in a pamphlet published at Lima, in, 1831, by General
  Freire, in exposition of his conduct during the civil war in
  Chile, 1829-30, is the following extract translated from the
  Spanish:</p>

  <div class="blockquot">
    <p>"It does not enter into my plan to justify the strategic
    movements which preceded the battle of Lircay. The
    disproportion between the contending forces was excessive.
    Neither tactics nor prodigies of valour could avail against
    this immense disadvantage. The liberals were routed. Would that
    I could throw a veil, not over a Conquest which proves neither
    courage nor talent in the conqueror, but over the horrid
    cruelties which succeeded the battle. The most furious savages,
    the most unprincipled bandits, would have been ashamed to
    execute the orders which the rebel army received from Prieto,
    and yet which were executed with mournful fidelity.
    Tupper&mdash;illustrious shade of the bravest of soldiers, of
    the most estimable of men; shade of a hero to whom Greece and
    Rome would have erected statues&mdash;your dreadful
    assassination will be avenged. If there be no visible
    punishment for your murderer, Divine vengeance will overtake
    him. It will demand an account of that infamous sentence
    pronounced against all strangers by a man<a name=

      his earliest youth he gave indications of that fearless and
      daring spirit which marked his after-life; and when he left
      Europe in 1821, he was generally thought to bear a striking
      resemblance to his late uncle, Major-General Brock, at the
      same age. This similarity extended in some degree even to
      their deaths, as the Indians of either continent were
      employed as auxiliaries in the actions in which they fell,
      and both were killed in the months that gave them birth. Like
      his uncle also, he swam occasionally to Castle Cornet and
      back, (see foot note, page 337,) and he was equally tall,
      being in height six feet two inches, while his figure was a
      perfect model of strength and symmetry.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
